</div>


<p>Three children were hopping among the daisies
in a beautiful grove near a stone mansion covered
with ivy. Their happy shouts and merry
laughter filled the air until the birds in the
branches twittered back from very happiness.</p>

<p>Two boys and one little girl made up the number,
and the girl was clapping her hands wildly,
watching the boys as they wrestled in the grass.</p>

<p>The larger of them brought the other down
upon his face and made him admit that the match
was over.</p>

<p>“I had you foul when I wound my leg about<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
yours,” explained he. “You cannot expect to
down a big fellow like me,” and the boy straightened
himself with a chuckle.</p>

<p>The girl ceased her laughing and came forward.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care, George Benson; Tom’s as
good as you are any day. That’s what he is.”</p>

<p>“Nobody said he wasn’t,” contemptuously replied
the lad, “but he can’t fight.”</p>

<p>Tom was watching George out of the corner
of his eye, trying to determine whether it would
be well to go at it again, when the girl spoke:</p>

<p>“Never you mind, Tommy; you come with me,
and I’ll ask papa for twenty-five cents, and then
we will go to the candy store.”</p>

<p>The boy addressed as George Benson followed
Tom and the girl.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be a tight-wad,” exclaimed he;
“stingy, stingy, stingy.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t stingy, George,” snapped Tom, “and
if you say she is stingy again, I’ll knuckle your
pate.”</p>

<p>“Stingy cat Annie, stingy cat Annie,” shouted<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
George loudly. “There now, here’s my head, you
knuckle it if you dare!”</p>

<p>With a bound Tom was up on the back of
George and was rubbing the curly head with a
vengeance. Back and forth they tottered upon
the lawn until the girl shouted:</p>

<p>“There, that’s enough now, Tom; just you show
him that you can lick him. Now, Mr. George, if
you’ll be good, you can go to the candy store with
us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want none of your old candy,” sulkily
replied the other. “I wouldn’t eat it fer nothing,
and I’ll get even with you, Mr. Tom, for knuckling
my pate.”</p>

<p>“Come on now and get even,” exclaimed Tom;
“you ain’t the only plug in the world.”</p>

<p>But George did not seem anxious to get even,
and he sent a stone flying after Annie Benson and
Tom Cooper.</p>

<p>“George can be so mean when he wants to be,”
sighed the girl.</p>

<p>“So he can. Now, why didn’t he come to the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
store after the fight? He had no right to call you
stingy.”</p>

<p>“No, for I always give him half of what I have,
after he spends his allowance that father gives
him.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a few moments, and then
the girl continued:</p>

<p>“I sometimes think that George is jealous of
you and me, and he ought not to be, for father
does as much for him as for any one else, and I
am papa’s own child.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are, Annie, while I am only a
little boy Mr. Benson was so good to. Never
mind, when I get big I’m going to marry you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t, Tom,” replied Annie, “for I am
four years older than you are. You would not
want to have your wife boss you, would you, Tom,
and I would have to if I was older than you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not always. I read in a book once,” proceeded
Tom earnestly, “about a man and a woman,
and she was ten years older than her husband,
and they were very happy.”</p>

<p>“Were they, really? I never heard of such a<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
thing. I thought the husbands had to be at least
twenty years older than the wife.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, no, and I’m going to have you for my
wife.”</p>

<p>Again there was silence. The girl was about
twelve, while the boy, although large for his age,
was but eight.</p>

<p>“George said he was going to marry me,” said
Annie after a while. “He said that my father
was very rich and that he being my cousin ought
to have the right to look after my money.”</p>

<p>“George ain’t good enough for you, Annie,”
hesitated Tom. “If you won’t tell I’ll tell you
something.”</p>

<p>“I promise, and cross my heart,” replied Annie.</p>

<p>“I saw Tom take money from your father’s
safe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, you really didn’t?”</p>

<p>“I really did,” answered the boy, hanging his
head.</p>

<p>“How could George be so wicked when papa is
so good to him. Why, he has had no father or<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
mother for many years. He and I are the same
age. My father and his are brothers.”</p>

<p>The girl’s mouth drooped at the corners and
her little face worked painfully, for as much as
she scolded her big cousin she loved him.</p>

<p>She never had had a brother, and now to find
this young lad whom she had taken into her heart
like one should be found wanting was hard to
bear.</p>

<p>“You are sure, Tommy dear?” asked she plaintively.</p>

<p>“More than sure, for he offered me five dollars
and I wouldn’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tom,” replied the girl, “and for
that I’ll marry you when you get to be a man.
You are a good fellow, Tommy.”</p>

<p>Annie Benson was the only child of her father,
her mother having died long ago.</p>

<p>The millionaire had taken under his control
his nephew, who had been left an orphan, also another
boy called Tom Cooper, the son of an old
friend. These three children had grown up together
and were like brothers and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>There was much love between them, with the
exception of George, who hated Tom Cooper and
wanted his cousin to himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with him for knuckling my nut,”
grumbled the lad as he watched the other two run
away. “I suppose he thinks he’s smart because
Annie’s going to buy candy. She ain’t the only
one; just look at that coin,” and he took out a
handful of money and pretended to show it to
some one. “’Taint every fellow that can show a
hand like that,” and he ran and jumped over a
large gatepost, evidently satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>Annie and Tom in the meantime climbed the
mansion steps, and the girl ran ahead, shaking
her golden curls in the wind.</p>

<p>She rapped lightly upon the library door and
stood patiently until she heard a kind voice call
out:</p>

<p>“Come in, little one, come in,” and the gentleman
put out his arms and the child sprang into
them.</p>

<p>“What does father’s baby want now?” asked he
lovingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Some money to go to the store for bon-bons
with Tommy. I don’t like Cousin George as much
as I do Tom and father,” and here the child hesitated.
“I have promised to marry Tom.”</p>

<p>This astounding statement caused the man to
throw back his head and give a great laugh.</p>

<p>“You needn’t laugh, father,” said the child,
wriggling from his arms and pouting a little; “if
Tommy and I want to get married, can’t we?”</p>

<p>Again the rich man chuckled, drawing the
child closely and looking into her eyes, and then
saying solemnly:</p>

<p>“Do you want to leave your father all alone,
without any one to love him?”</p>

<p>How many times in the future did the girl remember
these words! How many tears had she
shed over the remembrance of the loving embrace
he had given her when he told her that she could
not give away his baby, that she did not belong
to herself and was his own sweet child!</p>

<p>Annie Benson leaned confidently against her
father’s breast.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad that you want me, father,” sighed<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
she. “I love you very much indeed, and I’ll tell
Tom that I can’t marry him.”</p>

<p>With two coins in her hand and tender kisses
upon her lips, the girl scampered out to join the
waiting youngster upon the porch.</p>

<p>“Can’t marry you, Tom,” she shouted, “for
father says I belong to him and have no right to
give myself away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, why did you tell him yet? Of
course we are too little. Did he laugh?”</p>

<p>“Not only did he laugh,” replied Annie, “but
he shouted.”</p>

<p>“Mean of him,” muttered the lad, tears rising
in his eyes. “I suppose he thinks because I’m but
eight years old that I never will be a man, but,
never mind, I’ll show him.”</p>

<p>After that the children got their candy, but
neither the boy nor girl seemed to relish it much,
and when they reached home Annie’s father was
talking with George in the library.</p>

<p>“The master wants to see Master Tom for a few
moments,” said the butler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>The little lad tremblingly went to his benefactor.</p>

<p>“You wanted me, sir?” asked he softly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Come here, lad. Would you like to go
away to a good school for boys?”</p>

<p>“And leave Annie?” faltered the boy.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Benson; “but you don’t
always want to be around with girls, do you?”</p>

<p>“Is George going?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’ll have to go,” sobbed
Tommy; “but I don’t want to leave Annie.”</p>

<p>“Annie will go to school herself very soon,”
said the millionaire, “and then you would be left
alone.”</p>

<p>Gloom seemed to settle over the childish hearts
in the home as both boys vied with each other for
most of Annie’s attention, and Tom won out, for
the little girl could not forget that George had
taken money from her dear father, and the lad
pondered long over his cousin’s changed attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The children all went away to school, the millionaire
thinking it best to keep his girl from the
two boys, who might captivate her childish heart,
but little he thought that his ambitions for her
would be dashed to the ground by one wave of the
tiny white hand.</p>

<p>For four years the children met only in summer,
when the girl went traveling with a chaperone
and the boys stayed at home upon the estate.
Scarcely ever did they go to New York city
to live in the mansion excepting at Christmas,
when the family were in the city.</p>

<p>One holiday Annie came home in a different
mood than ever before, and her face would color
up when spoken to sharply or when surprised.</p>

<p>Her father and the boys noticed the difference,
but not one could understand the cause.</p>

<p>She had very little to say to any one, and one
afternoon her father called her to his study.</p>

<p>“Little maid,” said he tenderly, “is there anything
your father can say to you that will make
you any happier than you now are? Even Tommy
noticed that you were not your usual self.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Tommy is only a child, father,” said the girl
impetuously, “and he does not know what it
means to think.”</p>

<p>“Neither should you, child,” replied Mr. Benson;
“you are but sixteen. What have you in your
life to make you so thoughtful, or I might say
unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Not unhappy, father, not that,” cried the girl.</p>

<p>“Then, what?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—nothing. I am worried over my
studies.”</p>

<p>Mr. Benson sighed. He would have given much
to have had his child give him her confidence.
Her little heart was completely locked and would
not open for his knocking.</p>

<p>“You are positive that you are quite happy?”</p>

<p>“Quite positive.”</p>

<p>“And that you do not want for money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father dear, all the girls say how generous
you are with me.”</p>

<p>“Then there is nothing more I can say, is
there?”</p>

<p>He said this pleadingly, because his heart was<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
filled with sorrow for his darling. Suddenly she
burst into tears, and the curly head dropped upon
his arm and the child wept heartily.</p>

<p>After that there was more sympathy between
them.</p>

<p>Annie went back to school with a heavy heart.
She knew that she was keeping a weighty secret
from her father.</p>

<p>With her hands to her face and tears in her
eyes, she stepped from the train.</p>

<p>A young man, handsome, clever and spirited-looking
came to meet her.</p>

<p>“Why, darling, have you been crying, and why?
Did you not know that you were coming to your
sweetheart, and that he would care for you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, dear heart, I know,” sobbed the girl, “but
I had to lie to my father, and I love him so dearly,
Victor.”</p>

<p>“I know that, dearest, but we are going to tell
him just as soon as we are married. I cannot
wait any longer.”</p>

<p>Oh, Annie Benson, beloved of your father, had
you only told your handsome lover that you<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
would rather wait until your parent had given
his consent, how much better your life would
have been, but, woman-like, you could not refuse
the man you love.</p>

<p>“I wanted to wait,” murmured she softly.</p>

<p>“Then you do not love me,” said the lad sadly;
“you could not stay away from me for years if
you did care for me.”</p>

<p>“But, Victor, I do love you, indeed I do, but I
love father, too.”</p>

<p>“Then you will never be my wife, Annie.”</p>

<p>For a moment the girl stood thinking, and even
the angels in heaven wondered if she were going
to do what was right.</p>

<p>She simply turned with the love light shining
in her eyes, and laid her hand in his.</p>

<p>“My darling, I am yours when you are ready.”</p>

<p>“Then let it be to-day. Do not go back to
school, but come with me, and you will never
regret it.”</p>

<p>Regret it? Is there ever a sin in the world committed
that the sinner does not regret it?</p>

<p>No sooner had the marriage vow been taken, no<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
sooner had Annie Benson promised to love, honor
and obey Victor Standish, than she began to regret.</p>

<p>“Oh, Victor, I wish father knew,” said she,
“and that I was with Martha at school. The
girls will all be expecting me.”</p>

<p>“And you love the girls better than you do me,
your own husband?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I love you, Victor, and I will show
you what a good wife I can make.”</p>

<p>“And we will write to your father and tell him
all about it,” said the lad, “and he will forgive,
and maybe I can get something to work at in New
York. Would you not like to live with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed I would. That is all I am worrying
about, for my father loves me devotedly, and
I would not wound his feelings for the world.”</p>

<p>So a penitent letter, filled with sobbing appeals
to forgive her, arrived at the Benson mansion,
on Fifth avenue, at the appointed time.</p>

<p>The rich man was sitting alone when the butler
brought it. He read it and re-read it, and then
sat down to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>This child, whom he loved better than his life,
had without his consent married some no-account.</p>

<p>“Victor, Victor Standish; and who is he,
pray?”</p>

<p>Then his anger arose, and this is the letter he
wrote in reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Annie</span>:</p>

<p>“To say I was surprised and grieved would not
tell my emotion when I read your letter. I have
but this to say: When you feel ready to leave
this vagabond, and come back to your father, he
is ready to receive you. But with him you can
never come. I hope I shall hear from you in a
sensible way soon. Do not apply to me for money
while you are this man’s wife. Until that time
comes that you are free from him, I will simply
sign myself,</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Your Father</span>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>When Annie Standish read this letter she
swooned at her husband’s feet, for she had been
so sure that her father would forgive her and tell
her to come home immediately, that he would
take them both into his heart and home.</p>

<p>Victor Standish took the letter in his hands as
he supported his wife’s tottering steps and swore
that he would make this father-in-law retract his
words and welcome his daughter Annie home
again.</p>

<p>As he sat watching her a load of pain seemed
to rest upon his heart, for he had brought her to
this great agony, and by insisting that she marry
him he had separated her from home kindred, and
nothing was left to her but him, and he must
make up for all, and bring into her life every bit
of pleasure in his power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>Annie stirred and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“It isn’t true, is it, Victor?” cried she. “Oh, I
had such a dreadful dream, and I thought that
papa wouldn’t forgive me, and the thought was
more than I could bear.”</p>

<p>The tears started into the young husband’s
eyes. The pale face leaning against his arm was
so inexpressibly dear to him.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” murmured he, “would you feel
that you could not live for your husband, if——”</p>

<p>“Then it is true, it is true. Oh, papa, papa, how
could you do so to your little girl,” and the cry
that went up from the slender throat was never
forgotten by the young husband.</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, Annie, you will break my heart.”</p>

<p>After that they were silent, each suffering for
the sin committed.</p>

<p>They heard no more from the rich father, and
his pride would not bend. When the summer
came, and the fall ushered in the red leaves Annie
rose from a bed of sickness and brought a little
child with her, and with tears in her eyes she
whispered to her husband:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>“Sweetheart, I shall name her Helen after my
mother. I am sure that it will please my father.”</p>

<p>So the wee bit of humanity was christened, and
Annie Standish began to be happier.</p>

<p>Still the news of the little child’s birth did not
soften the banker’s heart, as he had said that he
would not forgive, and forgive he would not.</p>

<p>So the days went by until one afternoon Victor
came in with the news that his regiment had
been ordered out for active service.</p>

<p>“It will be a chance for me to make a name for
you and the baby,” said he lovingly. “Oh, Annie,
that is all I want to do, for I have an ambition to
make your father change his mind.”</p>

<p>“But, but,” faltered Annie, “you might get
killed, Victor, and then what would Helen and I
do? There would be no one left to us then.”</p>

<p>The soldier husband kissed away the bright
tears which flowed down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“There, there, Annie, we are going to pray that
I may come back to you very soon, when the war
is over, and, think of it, little wife, I may bring<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
back some stripes upon my sleeve, and you know
that will mean honor for us all.”</p>

<p>“And reconciliation with my father,” sighed
the girl.</p>

<p>The days seemed to fly between the time he was
ordered away and the day that her husband
started. Annie’s heart felt now that she had
nothing to live for but the dear baby, which had
filled up such a large gap in her life. Helen was
now nearly two years old, and her mother over
eighteen. She looked like a little girl herself, and
few would believe that the large rosy baby was
the offspring of the childish woman.</p>

<p>For two whole years the wife patiently waited,
waited for the home-coming of the soldier.
Twice she had written her father, and once had
visited his home. She had been told by her cousin
George that it was by the command of her father
that she was sent from his door almost starving.</p>

<p>Again she waited, but as a reward for her
patience there came a message from one of Victor’s
companions that he had died after receiving
a bullet in his body, and the only thing she had<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
from that foreign country was a little package of
her own letters and one partly finished by him
to her.</p>

<p>The night she received the package she sat up
long after Helen had retired, for the child was
too young to understand the mother’s grief.</p>

<p>“If father would only let us come home,” whispered
she after re-reading the letter. “I must do
something, and my health is growing poorer every
day.”</p>

<p>With this thought in her mind all the time, she
one morning took her baby and went to her father’s
home.</p>

<p>He surely would not send her away when he
knew that her husband was dead, and that <a id="BRef_23" href="#Ref_23">she
and Helen were starving.</a></p>

<div id="Ref_23" class="figcenter illowp47" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i037.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#BRef_23">“MAMA I AM SO HUNGRY.”</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>She carried the tottering child part of the way.</p>

<p>“Ah, little girl,” pleaded she when they were in
sight of the mansion, “won’t you be a good girl
and walk now? Mother’s arms are so tired.”</p>

<p>“Helen will walk, mother dear,” answered the
child, “but I’se so tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>The tears sprang into the mother’s eyes as she
heard this plaintive wail.</p>

<p>“Never mind, sweety, there is grandpa’s home,
and he will let us come in, and you shall see him.”</p>

<p>The great mansion loomed up mysteriously before
them, and the woman shuddered as she looked,
for she wondered if the hard-hearted old man
would turn his own child from his door again
starving.</p>

<p>She slowly crawled up the steps and rang the
bell. A strange butler answered and partly
closed the door when he saw the rags.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr. Benson,” faltered Annie.</p>

<p>“Mr. Benson, senior or junior?”</p>

<p>“Oh, senior. He is my father. I must see him
to-day.”</p>

<p>The man did not ask her to come in, but shut
the door in her face. He went hastily back to the
library, and then seeing but an old grey-haired
man sitting there he softly closed the door and
ran upstairs.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” came the voice from the
inside in answer to the slight knock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“The person is at the door you told me never to
allow in,” said the butler.</p>

<p>It took but a moment for George Benson to get
down stairs.</p>

<p>“Why, Annie,” said the soft voice, “I am very
sorry to see you in this condition, and you shall
have money, but do not come in. Your father is
so incensed against you that I would not answer
for the consequences if you should.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see him, George, so much. Do
not turn me away. My child and I are starving.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as far as money is concerned, I will
give you some, but I am sure your father will
refuse you admittance.”</p>

<p>“Ask him, any way, George,” pleaded she.</p>

<p>“Then, wait,” and the man swung gracefully
along the hallway.</p>

<p>The wasted old man sitting in the chair looked
up as his nephew entered.</p>

<p>“Want me, uncle?” asked the younger man.</p>

<p>“No, George,” replied the old man; “I was just
thinking of Annie and wondering if I should ever<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
see her again. Oh, George, do you ever think that
she will forgive me for turning from her?”</p>

<p>A dark shadow settled over the handsome
young face.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, uncle dear. It seems
if she were very anxious she would write to you
or in some way answer your letters.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, that’s so,” was the reply. “I suppose
she is satisfied in her husband’s love.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>With this George Benson came back to Annie
and said: “Poor little girl, he absolutely refuses
to see you.”</p>

<p>He slipped some money into the woman’s hand,
and she turned away with a broken heart.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Millionaire Benson sat in his library after the
departure of his nephew. He wanted his daughter
sorely, was willing to forgive her all, even her
husband, if she would but return, but there was
an evil influence at work about him, and many
times George Benson would spend hours in telling
him of Annie’s sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>As he sat there this morning and his nephew
had gone, another young man just out of college
ran up the stairs and burst into the library.</p>

<p>“Uncle,” said he lightly, “how are you to-day?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, my boy, pretty well. How are
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, more than well, and I do like my work so
much. They say at the bank that I am going to
be able soon to take a better position.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Tom,” cried the old man; “you shall
have any position in that bank you can earn; and
labor, boy, labor; that is the secret of success.”</p>

<p>“So it is, uncle, and you shall be proud of your
boy some day.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman sighed.</p>

<p>“I believe that, Tom,” replied he, “and I would
be satisfied with all my children if I could only
see my girl. One would think so sweet a character
as Annie would forgive her old stubborn
father, would they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” reluctantly replied the young man.</p>

<p>It is not hard to recognize in this lad the youth
who had fallen in love with Annie when he was<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
but a mere child. He had gone to college and
graduated. It had been a proud day when he was
installed in the bank as one of its employees, and
now he was telling his benefactor how willing he
was to work hard and climb to the top.</p>

<p>“I wish, too, that you could find Annie,” said
the lad, after a time of silence. “It seems as if she
would be willing to forgive you, even if for nothing
else, for what you could do for them. Have
you ever thought, uncle, that she might not have
gotten your letters?”</p>

<p>“I have not thought of that, but probably that
is it. Could you try and find out for me now?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I could and gladly would,” cried Tom,
“and maybe I shall bring her back. Now, where
was she when you last heard from her?”</p>

<p>The address was looked up and the old man
said:</p>

<p>“Now, if you find them, Tom, bring the whole
family back with you.”</p>

<p>Neither the old nor the young man knew that
there was a listener at the door, and that a
strangely handsome face was peering in with a<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
look of scorn upon the graceful, well-moulded
lips.</p>

<p>“So he is going to find her, is he, and make my
chances of a fortune not worth a picayune?
Well, his time is short in this mansion.”</p>

<p>He stole away, and Tom, with an affectionate
embrace, left his uncle.</p>

<p>For a long time the old man sat and dreamed,
dreamed of a woman, sweet, in the long ago days
when he was young and she was beautiful, dreamed
of that time when a little child, with light
golden hair, had been born to them, and of their
happiness and joy. Then later, when the first
shadow fell upon the home and the gentle spirit
of his wife took flight and left him.</p>

<p>Then, after that, he had but the little girl, and
she had lived and reigned in his heart for sixteen
short years, and had gone like a shade of night,
but it had been a great deal his own fault. Why
did he not overlook the foolish step and try to
make something of her husband? As he sat there
he slumbered slightly, and then over his mind
came a scene of the past. A child, with long curls,<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
flitted before him, and he saw her flying away
over the lawn and once in a while she looked back
at him, her eyes smiling sweetly and the tiny
hand shaking him a farewell, and then another
dream as sweet as the last one flitted close upon
his brain.</p>

<p>A dignified girl, in a white dress, sat beside
him, and he heard his own voice say:</p>

<p>“Tell me, Annie, is there anything I can do to
make you happy?” and before he could stop her
he saw her fading away and dissolving into the
shadows upon the wall.</p>

<p>He lifted his hands and gave a great groan.</p>

<p>“Annie,” murmured he, “come back to your
father.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, uncle?” shouted George
Benson. “Why do you mutter in your sleep?
There, wake up, a dream is only a dream anyway.”</p>

<p>The old man sat up thoughtfully, and with
tears in his eyes said:</p>

<p>“I dreamed that Annie was here, George, and,
oh, I want my child, I want my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>Impatiently George Benson sat down, for he
had not patience with this imbecile old man.</p>

<p>“I would not waste my energy upon the ungrateful
girl,” said he, “for she does not seem to
care, or why should she not answer your letters?
It is shameful for a daughter to be so undutiful.”</p>

<p>There was something in the young man’s tone
that caused the millionaire to look keenly at him.</p>

<p>Then he closed his lips upon the words that
were about to fall. He was upon the point of confiding
how Tom was going after Annie, but the
rich man noticed a glitter in the blue eyes, and
he said nothing.</p>

<p>Then George spoke slowly:</p>

<p>“Uncle, will you keep to yourself what I am
going to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” responded the rich man; “I have
never betrayed your confidence.”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Then, I will not begin now.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that Tom Cooper thinks that
you are going to leave him half your fortune? I
saw him just now as he went out, and he said that<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
you had asked him to help find Annie, and that he
was not going to do anything like it, but to give
you the idea that he was working hard to locate
her, and he said that if she kept away from the
house that you would leave him half your fortune.”</p>

<p>The old man was rising from his chair slowly.</p>

<p>“Are you telling me the truth?”</p>

<p>“Surely. He said that you two talked over the
matter, and that you asked him to aid you in finding
the girl, and he said he had given you the idea
that he could bring her back to you.”</p>

<p>“So he did,” ejaculated the old man.</p>

<p>“And I fear that he intends to do you wrong, as
much as I hate to say it of the fellow whom I
have grown up with, but then we could not expect
to have him care as much for Annie as I do, not
being related to her.”</p>

<p>For a long time the old man sat in his chair
muttering to himself. He had grown to love this
boy, this very young boy, who had always sent in
the best reports from college to him, like his own
son even. But the last blow had fallen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Annie,” he whispered as he labored upstairs
to his bedroom, “I shall never see you again. You
have had your revenge now, for I shall not be
upon the earth long.”</p>

<p>Then he sent for his nephew after his valet had
put him in bed, and said:</p>

<p>“If Tom Cooper comes here, he is to be refused
admittance; also notify the bank that he is to be
discharged.”</p>

<p>After George Benson heard this he went down
stairs, and with a malicious smile upon his face
wrote the letter, and as he dropped it in the mail
box, he said to himself:</p>

<p>“So you will find the girl, will you, Tom Cooper?
We will soon see what your future will
amount to.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning Tom Cooper came whistling
into the bank. His future looked so bright, and
did he not have his uncle’s permission to find the
little lost girl? He went behind the glass window
and found a notice upon his desk to call
upon the president in his room, and without delay
the lad ran into the rear of the building and
tapped lightly upon a door marked, “T. D. Dalton.”</p>

<p>“You wished to see me, sir,” and then he stopped,
for the grave face before him gave his heart
a chill.</p>

<p>“Yes, lad; sit down.”</p>

<p>Tom Cooper slid into the chair, a strange feeling
coming over him.</p>

<p>“Have you done anything to offend Mr. Benson?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Something has happened then, for I have this
in the morning mail.”</p>

<p>Tom took the paper mechanically in his fingers,
and there before him was an order to take
his position from him, and only yesterday his
benefactor had been so pleasant. While he held
the letter in his hand he could not help but think
that George Benson had been instrumental in his
downfall.</p>

<p>He went from the bank to the mansion, only to
find that he was barred from there, and Mr. Benson
refused to see him, and as he left the steps for
the last time in his life a face watched him from
an upper window.</p>

<p>“So you are going to throw over my scheme, are
you, Tom Cooper? Well, I don’t think so. Now
go and starve with my pretty cousin, and do not
forget that when you hold a good position it
might slip from your fingers before you are aware
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>From that day on Tom Cooper could find nothing
to do, and he haunted the places of his friends
until at last one day he met an old chum upon
the street.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet, Cooper?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“No, and I am thinking of going to sea for a
while. I can take a position and go around the
world, and be gone three months, and maybe by
that time something will open for me.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” sympathized the other, “for you had
the best prospects of any of the fellows graduating
in your class.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t now,” bitterly answered Cooper,
“and good-bye, old fellow. When I return I’ll
let you know my success.”</p>

<p>After this it was smooth sailing for George
Benson. Tom out of the way, and his cousin not
to be found, and his uncle sick in bed afflicted
with paralysis.</p>

<p>What more could a man want than a fortune at
his fingers’ end, and nothing in the way but an
old man, with one foot in the grave, and the doctor
gave but little hope of his living long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>One morning George Benson had gone out
when the doctor arrived, and the good man ran
up the stairs and looked into the old man’s chamber
without being announced.</p>

<p>There were tears upon the wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Benson, are you in such pain?” said
the doctor in great sympathy.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you weeping for? Tell me;
maybe I can help you.”</p>

<p>“No one can do that, Johnson,” replied the millionaire;
“I am weeping for my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Your daughter? I did not know that you had
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I have, but I do not know where. She
was a good little girl, but married against my
will, and for a time I returned all of her letters,
and she has since then refused to forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Well, well; this is interesting. Tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>It eased the poor, throbbing heart to tell the
painful story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“And your child has refused to answer you in
any way?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are sure that she got the message?”</p>

<p>The old man looked into his physician’s eyes,
and remembered that Tom Cooper had asked that
same question.</p>

<p>“As sure as a man can be who has to confide his
affairs to a third party.”</p>

<p>“And that party your nephew?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Would you think me impertinent, my dear
Mr. Benson, if I should say that I believe your
daughter has never received your letters, and another
thing I would ask you: How have you made
your will?”</p>

<p>“In my nephew’s favor.”</p>

<p>“And do you think that right to your daughter?
What if she never received your letters, or
if she had died and left a child?”</p>

<p>“She had a little baby, I know,” sadly replied
the old man.</p>

<p>“Then it seems a shame that while you have an<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
own child that you should not at least have her
provided for. Think of it, she may be in distress
and not know that you have wanted her.”</p>

<p>The old man started up in bed and held out his
feeble hand and said:</p>

<p>“Doctor, will you help me? Oh, I beg of you to
make it possible for my child to again look into
my face, and I shall bless you forever.”</p>

<p>“Then, one thing,” gravely replied the physician,
“is that you should make another will immediately,
and you should keep the fact from
your nephew until after it is over.”</p>

<p>“Will you send for my lawyer now?” tremblingly
asked the rich man.</p>

<p>“I want you to witness my will, and swear that
I am in my right mind.”</p>

<p>So the telephone was brought into use, and the
family lawyer was hurried into the mansion, and
for some hours the three men were closeted together,
and a servant was brought into the room
to witness the will.</p>

<p>They were still there when George Benson
came home. He heard that the doctor was still<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
with his uncle, but no one said anything about a
lawyer.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait down here until he comes down,”
muttered the young man to himself. “I hate to
hear uncle complain of his aches and pains, and
he is such a bore. I shall be glad when he is
dead.”</p>

<p>But he knew not that in that upper chamber
a deed was being enacted which would place
him upon the pauper list as far as money was
concerned.</p>

<p>“I wish you would stay here with me,” said the
rich man to the lawyer, “until my nephew returns,
and tell him of the change in my will, and
I do not think he will mind it much, for he always
pretended to care a great deal for his cousin.”</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled sarcastically and answered.</p>

<p>“I shall not leave you, Mr. Benson, and what
shall I do with this old will?”</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” responded the rich man, and
he took the document in his fingers, and having
split it in two asked that it should be burned before
his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>After accomplishing this the lawyer sat down
and waited, and in the meantime the doctor met
the nephew in the hall, and, shaking hands, replied
that the invalid was somewhat better.</p>

<p>“He wants to be kept quiet, that is all,” replied
the doctor.</p>

<p>“He can have all the quiet he wants, for all of
me,” responded the young man with a shrug of
his shoulders; “I am not in love with the air of a
sick chamber.”</p>

<p>“I have observed that,” dryly replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Well—well—would you mind if I were to ask
a plain question, doctor?” and as the medical
man inclined his head, he proceeded with little
show of embarrassment:</p>

<p>“You see, my uncle will always be an invalid,
will he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And can you tell approximately how long this
lingering disease will last?”</p>

<p>“Then I understand that you want to know
how soon your uncle is going to die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>George blushed at the plain words.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly that, but when I come to
think, yes, doctor, that is it. Will he live long?”</p>

<p>“He may live for some years, but not likely.
Certainly not if he is worried in any way.”</p>

<p>“Then he will live forever if all he needs is
quiet and lack of worry, as I have taken every
burden from him.”</p>

<p>The doctor wondered what this suave young
fellow would say when he heard that the will had
been changed and he had been forgotten.</p>

<p>“He will probably live as long as you want him
to, Mr. Benson,” said the doctor, and then he
went down the steps and could but think of the
little daughter married to a soldier, and pondered
upon the fact that she would be worth a fortune
when her father should close his eyes in death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>George Benson ran up the stairs to his uncle’s
room, but he did not know that the family lawyer
was there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said he, holding out his
hand, the truth never once coming across his
mind.</p>

<p>“How are you, uncle?” said he, walking up to
the bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, so, so, boy,” replied the sick man. “I have
done something which I hope you will think is
just. I have made a new will leaving Annie my
fortune.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>The cry in the one word was enough to startle
each man. The aged invalid raised on his elbow,
and looked into the contorted face. The lawyer
was thankful that he had stayed, for he believed
and told the doctor afterward that he thought
George Benson would have killed his uncle if he
had not been there.</p>

<p>Without noticing the attorney, he broke out:</p>

<p>“How dare you tell me that? Do you think
that I am going to allow you to do anything like
that? What did I get rid of that young rascal,
Tom Cooper, for, and many others who have<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
stood in my way? You need not think that I am
going to let you cut me off without a penny.”</p>

<p>“You’ll let me do what I wish with my money,
my own money,” muttered the sick man. “What
business is it of yours what I do? You would
have had none of it if I had had my child with
me.”</p>

<p>George Benson’s face took upon it a terrible
expression.</p>

<p>“Oh, you think you are going to see Annie, do
you? Well, know the truth, and if it kills you it
serves you right, for Annie was here only the
other day, begging to see you, and I sent her away
starving with her child. She will not see you
again, for a thinner girl never applied for alms
to any one before.”</p>

<p>“Shame, shame,” cried the lawyer, as the old
man toppled back in his bed and covered his face
with his hands. “Shame on a man who would
torment a dying father. You are a brute, Benson,
and I am glad you have been foiled.”</p>

<p>The younger man’s passion had spent itself,
and George realized that he had made a bad<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
break; that he had lost his temper and forgotten
that he might undo the deed done that day. He
turned upon his heel and ran out of the room.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be left alone,” moaned Mr.
Benson. “There is no telling what he might do
to me in that temper, and to think that my little
girl has been here, maybe time and time again,
and I did not know it. Oh, my good friend, you
must help me find her.”</p>

<p>The lawyer, promising and saying that he
would leave instructions with Mr. Benson’s valet
and that he would take the new will with him,
for fear it would be tampered with, went away.</p>

<p>After that everything known to science and
law was done to bring the old man and his daughter
together. The doctor gave tonics, and the
lawyer advertised for the girl.</p>

<p>George Benson bitterly regretted his rash
speech, for he had opened avenues whereby the
chance of his regaining his old position was gone.</p>

<p>One day he stole into the library and looked
hastily about.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to have money, and I might as well<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
take these diamonds,” he said to himself. “There
is no telling how soon I shall be ordered from the
mansion. What tommy rot all this bustle is, for
they won’t find the girl—or, at least, I hope they
won’t.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he slipped his fingers into a private
panel in the wall and pulled out a small box
and looked greedily at the contents.</p>

<p>“Abe Nathans will give me at least a thousand
on these, and let me out of some of the worry he
has given me before.”</p>

<p>Out of the room he went slyly, and hid the box
in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I am not going to be without money,” said he
as he was again in his room safely with the trinkets.
“If the old man doesn’t realize that I am
to have a certain amount, then I will take it myself.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Three months had elapsed since Tom Cooper
had left the big bank, and nothing had been heard
of him, save that he had gone to sea. There were
many times the old man felt that he had wronged<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
the boy in sending him away without a word of
explanation, but his heart was so full of finding
Annie that he had no place for even Tom, and the
doctor and lawyer had it so arranged that George
could not see his uncle at all. If the old man had
only known the truth about his young ward he
would have inserted an advertisement for him in
the paper.</p>

<p>But not knowing, Tom Cooper was allowed to
come into the city without a friend to meet him,
and his boat landed one evening just at dusk, and
he had not yet received his month’s pay.</p>

<p>So, thinking that he needed a little money, he
rolled up a suit of clothes and walked toward the
nearest pawn shop.</p>

<p>Before he had done this another young man
had gone in the same direction.</p>

<p>He opened the door, the bell sounding through
the place.</p>

<p>“Are you here, Abe?” shouted he.</p>

<p>“Comin’, comin’,” was the grunted answer.
“Oh, so it is you, Mr. Benson. I hope you don’t
want more money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“That’s just what I do want,” went on George
Benson, “and I brought you the family jewels,
though I had a darned hard job to get them. If I
had never spied upon the old man I would not
have known where they were. Lucky for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very lucky, my dear Mr. Benson,” answered
the Jew, rubbing his white hands together,
“for if you had not had them I should
have given you no more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ring those old changes on me,” stuttered
George, “for you know you would give me
money if I demanded it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, no more; no more.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, you’ve got the jewels, so don’t
grumble; don’t grumble.”</p>

<p>He held out the box, and the old man took the
jewel box greedily in his hands.</p>

<p>“Ah, they are beauties. I well remember them.
I was the one who got them for your uncle, and
he gave them to his wife Helen, and she was a
beauty. Then his daughter got them in her turn,
and I suppose you do not hear anything of the
girl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>“No, and I hope to heaven that she is dead.
You see in that case I will get the money anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will,” replied the Jew. “Ain’t
your uncle given you all of it before now? You
told me he had made a will remembering you and
you only.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” bitterly replied the other;
“that’s true, but he did not become paralyzed in
his hands, did he? He could change it any time
he wanted to.”</p>

<p>“So he could,” responded the Jew, thoughtfully;
“but the question is, did he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did.”</p>

<p>“Then how am I going to get my money?” asked
the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, Abe, for the love of heaven, don’t be so
selfish. If I don’t get it then you won’t, but by
putting our heads together, I am sure we can circumvent
this lawyer and doctor who have seen fit
to put their noses in other people’s business, and
I’ll show them that it is not safe to meddle with
fire if they don’t want to get burned.”</p>

</div>


<p>“I don’t see how I can help you any,” ventured
the pawnbroker, looking furtively at his companion.</p>

<p>“Well, you can; the first thing I need is money,
and I must have it.”</p>

<p>“Go on with your scheme,” said the other, “and
don’t always be talking about money. I know
that promises don’t amount to much. Now then,
what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to keep that girl from her father,
and then I am one of the trustees of the money,
and if he does not change that part I shall be all
right for ready cash as soon as he shuffles off, but
I spoke my mind the night he made the new will,
and there is no telling what he will do, only that
his hands now are useless.”</p>

<p>“Then you care for the funds?” began the
broker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, until this girl puts in an appearance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let her appear,” said the other.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I say,” went on Benson
laughingly. “I know that I can put her somewhere
that she won’t bother me. Now, old man,
will you help me, and I’ll see that you are well
paid?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Just at this moment a young fellow with the
air of a sailor came in.</p>

<p>“Are you the chump what runs this place?”
asked he, going up to the pawnbroker, “for if you
are I want to pawn this suit of clothes. They are
bran’ new, and ought to give me a little ready
cash.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look at them when I get through with this
gentleman,” and the broker turned disdainfully
away.</p>

<p>Then the two, Tom Cooper and Benson, recognized
each other.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Tom, you do look like a typical<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
Jack in earnest. So you’ve come back to try your
luck, have you, again upon land?”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree, to get even with you, Mr. Benson,”
replied the sailor. “You lied about me; that I
know. Now I am going to see just what you are
doing, Mr. George Benson.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you monkey in my affairs,” shouted
George, “or I will deal with you as I did before.
You went from New York because I made
it too hot to hold you. Now, be careful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you’d like to hurt me all right.
I went to see Mr. Benson last night, and they said
he was too sick to see anyone.”</p>

<p>“So he is, to see a ragmuffin,” sneered Benson.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he harbors you, if he is so very
particular,” retorted Tom.</p>

<p>“So you tried to get into the house, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why not? It was my home, the same as
yours.”</p>

<p>“Not quite. You always were an interloper, so
beware.”</p>

<p>Tom leaned far over and looked keenly at Benson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“What have you done with Annie Benson?”</p>

<p>“What have I done with her?” replied Benson
threateningly. “I don’t know anything about
her. She is nothing to me.”</p>

<p>How George Benson would have liked to have
told the young fellow that he was the beneficiary
to his uncle’s will, but he knew that the boy
would find out differently, so he remained silent.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Nathans. “Did the
old man give you the grand bounce, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not for anything that I did, but because
of that villain standing there. I suppose
he thought that I would help find Miss Annie and
bring her back to her home. Well, that’s what I
came back for, Mr. Benson.”</p>

<p>Tom Cooper saw that he was putting the thorns
into the other’s flesh, and kept on: “I am going
to spend the rest of my days finding that girl.”</p>

<p>Benson walked close to him and looked into his
face.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you something, Tom Cooper,
you had better go back to sea, for if you don’t I<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
can tell you that there won’t be much show for
you if I once get my hands on you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you, mister,” shouted Tom,
snapping his fingers into George’s face.</p>

<p>“And, what’s more,” he added, “I have made up
my mind that you are not playing fair with our
little playmate of long ago, any more than you
used to play fair when you stole money from her
father’s pocket. But I am going to find her if it
takes me all the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>“What’s that girl to you?” slowly asked George.</p>

<p>“Nothing, but I cannot forget the times when
we were children that she was with us, and now
I am sure that she is having a hard time of it, and
I am going to find out anyhow.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment a woman came in with a
clock in her hand.</p>

<p>“What will you give for this, Abe?” asked she.
“Now, don’t be tight about it, for the girl I’m
a-selling it for is almost starved to death, and I
am going to pay her rent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re like all the rest, Higgins,” blurted
the broker, “always got some reason why you<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
should have money, more money than any one
else. You would have me in the poorhouse if you
had your way.”</p>

<p>“But I must have two dollars for this,” insisted
the woman. “Please, Abe, it will save a
woman from being turned out.”</p>

<p>“What do I care whether she is turned out or
not as long as I don’t have to take care of her?”
sulkily asked the broker.</p>

<p>The pawnbroker left the woman for a moment
to attend to a boy, who came in with a watch.</p>

<p>“I want to get money on this,” said he.</p>

<p>The broker looked suspiciously at him.</p>

<p>“You stole this?” asked he softly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I found it.”</p>

<p>“Now, look a-here, Jim Farren, I ain’t got no
confidence in what you say. You stole the last
thing you brought to me, and I had to give it up
to the detective.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal that nuther,” sulkily replied the
boy.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I was out five dollars, and unless
you can prove that you got this all right, then<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
you will have to take it elsewhere, and give me
back that five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Like fun I will,” replied the boy, and he
slouched out.</p>

<p>In the meantime the woman was listening to
the spirited conversation between the two other
men. She could hear Tom stand up firmly for the
girl called “Annie.”</p>

<p>When she saw the pawnbroker go back to Benson
and resume his conversation with him, she
went up to Tom:</p>

<p>“I heard you a-speaking to the young gentleman
about finding a girl by the name of Annie.
I know one a-living near me in the next room,
and her father is rich. He sent her from home
because she married against his will, and she has
one little girl named Helen.”</p>

<p>“Helen,” muttered Tom thoughtfully, looking
at the woman as if he were trying to bring something
into his mind; “Helen, that was the name
of her mother. Will you take me to this girl, that
I may see her?”</p>

<p>“Sure I will. Let me get this old stick to give<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
me the money I want, and then I’ll go with you.”
With this she took the two dollars which the
man gave to her begrudgingly, and out of the
shop they went, and Mrs. Higgins led the way to
her apartment.</p>

<p>But she did not notice that a poor woman
walked along the street with her child by the
hand. This was one of those cases when it would
have been well for the woman to tell of the charity
which she was going to bestow, for then the
tired sick mother would not have left her home.</p>

<p>She hurried on until she, too, reached the
pawnshop and stepped inside, dragging the frail
child with her.</p>

<p>She walked to the counter with slow steps and
said in a weak voice:</p>

<p>“I should like to pawn this jewel for as much
money as you can give me.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you much,” said the broker, “for
it is plated.”</p>

<p>The woman raised her eyes pleadingly.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said she. “My father gave
it to me as a pure gem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>“Then your father was fooled,” said the broker,
“for it is nothing but the meanest kind of a
plate.”</p>

<p>The woman looked about hastily.</p>

<p>“What will you give for it?” said she weakly.</p>

<p>“Two dollars.”</p>

<p>“Two dollars! Why it cost thousands. I know
that you are cheating me. I shall not leave it.”</p>

<p>“Then take it somewhere else, and don’t bother
me with it. I’ll be with you in a moment, Benson.”</p>

<p>The woman again looked about.</p>

<p>“What, Benson,” whispered she, and then she
caught sight of the cousin who had been the
cause of all of her trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you are here, George Benson? Oh, I
am so glad to see you. I want to see my father,
for I saw in the paper that he was very sick.”</p>

<p>“So he is,” surlily replied Benson, “and he does
not want to be bothered with you. Now, keep
away from the house, for the servants have had
instructions to keep you out.”</p>

<p>“Where is Tom Cooper?” asked the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>“Gone to the devil, for all I know,” said Benson,
looking at the little bundle upon the floor,
which by some great stroke of fate Tom Cooper
had left there.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure not so bad as that,” said she
wistfully. “It is a shame to talk that way of him.
Why, George, as a boy he was better than you.”</p>

<p>“Where is your husband?” asked Benson,
knowing well enough that he was dead, for he
had opened all the letters that had come in her
handwriting.</p>

<p>“Dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, it was not all honey after you married
him, was it?”</p>

<p>“He was good to me, and I believe that you
made my father turn from me, and I will go
straight to him and tell him that you have kept us
apart.”</p>

<p>The pawnbroker came up at this moment.</p>

<p>“Miss, if you have any crying to do, please go
out, for I don’t want you in here,” and, saying
this, he gave poor Annie Standish a shove and
sent her into the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“Such people set me crazy,” stormed the old
man, “as if my shop was to be a fountain. I hate
them all, that’s what I do.”</p>

<p>“That woman makes me feel as if I had nothing
to live for,” gasped Benson. “Just you let Tom
Cooper see her, and I’ll bet you that my cake will
be dough in five minutes, but give me the money.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that your uncle told you that
you could have these diamonds when he was no
more? Now, if they should make a search for
them and claim that they were stolen, then I
would have no chance but to give them up. Now
then, out with the truth.”</p>

<p>“Of course he told me that I could have them.
Don’t be a fool.”</p>

<p>As the question was being argued the door
opened and a detective appeared.</p>

<p>“Nathans,” said he brusquely, “there has been
a set of diamonds stolen from Benson’s mansion,
and they will probably be brought here, and if
so you keep them, for they will be wanted.”</p>

<p>The blood flew into George’s face, and he
stepped upon the toe of the pawnbroker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>Nathans feared that the box on the desk would
be spied by the detective.</p>

<p>“I’ll watch,” said he after a while, “and if the
jewels come in I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“All right, and another thing, Benson is dying,
and he wants his daughter, and if you should see
a poor woman come here to pawn anything don’t
let her go away without asking her name, for it
might be worth your while.”</p>

<p>“I don’t trouble myself about such people,”
said the broker, “but as long as you want me to
I’ll keep on the watch.”</p>

<p>He had only turned his back for a moment before
the pawnbroker was upon the young man.</p>

<p>“So you think that I was going to pay you a
thousand for stolen goods. You are as bad as
that Farren. I can’t watch you fellows enough.”</p>

<p>“You’d better give me some money, Nathans.
How am I going to do work with nothing? Now
then, keep the jewels.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want them.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there came into the eyes of the other<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
a light which made Nathans ask Benson what he
was thinking about.</p>

<p>“Put that box in that bundle of Tom Cooper,
and by that way we will get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“And make it appear that he stole the jewels?”</p>

<p>“And why not?” asked George. “Would it not
get him out of the way for at least five years, and
if the girl is not found by that time I would not
give much for the fortune she would find in the
meantime.”</p>

<p>“But how are you going to let the police know
that he stole that box?” asked Nathans.</p>

<p>“I’ll skip out and send the police, and then
when he comes back you pick a quarrel with him,
and when that happens cry out and the police
will nab him, and then the searching of his
bundle will make it look as if he stole the jewels
when he was at the mansion last night.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, old fellow; you’re all right. Here
goes,” and into the sailor’s bundle the jewels were
slipped, but neither of the men knew that under
the counter was a shaggy little head, and that
when they were not looking a red hand was<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
slipped to get the bundle and to relieve it of the
gems, but the incoming of Tom just at that moment
gave him no opportunity and the sailor
ejaculated: “Well, old cove, what are you going
to give me for these clothes? I went all the way
to that old Irish lady’s house, and sure enough
the woman wasn’t there. I suppose that she had
lit out to raise the dough for grub for herself and
babe.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he took up the bundle and shook it
lightly.</p>

<p>“Those clothes don’t look like much, for they’ve
been wrapped upon the ship, but they’re new, old
sport.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t call me such names as that, young
man,” said the pawnbroker.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” laughed the sailor jovially,
“for when a man gets as old and shriveled as you
are it shows that he’s been something of a sport
in his life.”</p>

<p>The pawnbroker looked furtively about.</p>

<p>“What you want on the clothes?”</p>

<p>“What’ll you give?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid you stole them.”</p>

<p>The sailor drew up his big form slowly and
sent his sleeve up to his elbows.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, do you? Well, I’ll smash your
face if you talk that way to me, you dirty old
Jew.”</p>

<p>The pawnbroker had the chance he wanted, for
he shouted out loud and his clerk came running
in.</p>

<p>“Call an officer, call an officer, for pity’s sake.
This man is going to fight me.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to hurt the old swab,” cried
Tom as the policeman laid his fingers on his
strong arm, “but the fool said I stole that bundle,
and it’s my clothes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you come along with me, my young man,
for I think I’ve seen you before.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“In front of Mr. Benson’s home, on Fifth avenue,
last night, and there was a great robbery
committed there a little later.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p>“A robbery?” muttered Tom. “Well, old pard,
it wasn’t me.”</p>

<p>While the argument was going on a little fellow
slipped like a rat from his hiding place, and
would have scurried away but the pawnbroker
held him tightly.</p>

<p>“Where were you, you little devil?” whispered
he.</p>

<p>“Under the counter.”</p>

<p>“And heard all?”</p>

<p>“Every word.”</p>

<p>“Then keep your mouth shut, and I’ll help you
out of the watch scrape.”</p>

<p>The officer saw that there was another prisoner
for him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Jimmie Farren,” cried the detective.
“You are the youngster that stole that watch?
Now come with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t steal the watch; I just found it.”</p>

<p>Tom threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“We are innocent, aren’t we, pard? Well, if
we have to go with the police, come along like a
man, but they will soon ship me, for I am as innocent
as a new-born lamb.”</p>

<p>He played his fingers on the end of his nose to
the pawnbroker and left the shop, following the
detective.</p>

<p>“When I come back, I’ll fix you, you old skate,”
said he just as the door slammed in his face.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, so he will come back, will he? Well I
guess he won’t. That was a smart thing that
George Benson thought of, and I tell you any one
that gets in that man’s path he will knock out
quicker than a wink.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At the station house Tom stood before the captain
and gave a history of himself. He told how
he was a former ward of Mr. Benson, how he had
lived there for many years and then of his sudden
dismissal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“And what are you here for?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Because he raised a row in a pawnshop.”</p>

<p>“And what were you going to pawn?”</p>

<p>“My clothes in that bundle,” and the sailor
pointed to the package in the officer’s hand.</p>

<p>“What’s in it?”</p>

<p>“A new suit of clothes I bought in England,
and we landed in town yesterday, and I haven’t
drawn any money yet, so had to pawn my
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Open the package,” ordered the sergeant.</p>

<p>The officer obeyed and out rolled a small box
of velvet which the man picked up doubtfully, and
all were looking at the box as the policeman
handed it over to the leader.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he asked of Tom Cooper.</p>

<p>The young sailor was looking at the box in mystified
silence.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said he at last, and there was
one in the room who knew that he did not know,
for Jim Farren had seen and heard what passed
between George Benson and the Jew, and knew<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
that this young man was a victim of their conspiracy,
but for his own sake he dared not speak,
for there would be a chance for him if he stood in
with the old Jew, but he knew that there would
be nothing done if he should try to aid the young
sailor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few words would not be amiss about this
young man Jim Farren. Brought up in one of
the toughest parts of New York, he had had no
influence to aid him into a better life. He would
steal and then lie out of it, but this time he had
been caught in his own trap. What a fool he had
been to go to that shop after pawning a watch
which of course would be identified.</p>

<p>He was thus thinking when he heard the sailor
say stoutly:</p>

<p>“Well, whether you believe me or not, I did not
steal those gems,” and for the first time in his life
Jim Farren had an impulse to say, “He did not,
for I saw the thief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next day the papers were full of the robbery
and the skilful catching of the thief. George
Benson went and shook hands with the pawnbroker,
and said: “If we had not worked this
fellow off of our hands we would have been in a
pickle just now.”</p>

<p>When George got home he found that his uncle
had sent his lawyer to the inner closet in the library,
giving him a design of the room, and the
attorney found that the jewels were gone.</p>

<p>It was in this way that the detectives took up
the case, and they were located in a pawnshop
which belonged to one Nathans.</p>

<p>It gave the name of Tom Cooper, and old Mr.
Benson turned upon his pillow with a groan
when he found that the boy he had loved and
taken care of from a baby had been the serpent
that stung him in a most vital place, for had not
his Helen, his wife and beloved, worn these precious
diamonds about her neck, and had not his
daughter, whom he loved, also had them close to
her beating heart? For many hours after this<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
revelation was made to him he said nothing, and
then he opened his lips.</p>

<p>“It is dreadful to be treated thus. I loved this
boy, and was on the eve of sending for him to find
out the truth of the matter of a few months ago,
but if these gems were found upon him then there
can be no excuse for him.”</p>

<p>It was strange that the old invalid did not
think it about time to send his nephew from his
home, especially after the terrible confession
George had made about his daughter, but Benson
felt that George was his own flesh and blood, and
how could he find it in his heart to turn him
away? He had grown more tender since the leaving
of his Annie. He would put all the worry out
of his mind, with the exception of thoughts of
Annie, and for her he would wish until the very
air produced vibrations that would bring her
back to him.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe, George,” said the lawyer
one morning after Tom’s sentence had been
passed upon him and he had been sent up for a<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
number of years, “that this young sailor took
these gems?”</p>

<p>“I only know,” responded the smooth villain,
“as much about the case as you. I do not worry
about strangers.”</p>

<p>“Was this young man not a boy brought up
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, he is not a stranger to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is no blood relation, and I am not
being put through the third degree, am I?”</p>

<p>The lawyer went out with the firm conviction
that this young man, with his handsome eyes,
knew more about this plot of the diamond theft
than he cared to admit.</p>

<p>George Benson threw himself out of the room
with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad when the old man is dead,” muttered
he as he swung off up the avenue, “for he
has such a set of inquisitors about him that they
drive me out of my senses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When poor Annie staggered out of the pawnshop
with her pretty bauble in her fingers she ran
into another woman hurrying along.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor darling,” said the warm-hearted
newcomer; “you ain’t about this kind of
a day, and no warm clothes on? Now, be a good
girl and come back home with me. Where have
you bin?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to pawn this trinket, but he
told me that it wasn’t worth over two dollars.
And I know better, for my father gave it to me.
Oh, Biddy Roan, if the time ever comes that I can
repay you and Mrs. Higgins for your kindness to
me, then will I come back and make you comfortable.
But now I am going away.”</p>

<p>She turned and made her way toward the other
street swiftly, and would not listen to the strong
Irish voice that commanded her to return. She
walked hastily along until she came to Broadway
and took this thoroughfare down and seemed bent
upon making a certain point before the turning
of the night, but fate seemed to have overtaken
this poor woman, and with her heart beating and<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
her lips praying for her father’s forgiveness she
swept on, dragging the whining child through
the now shadowy streets.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, I am so tired,” cried the child.</p>

<p>“I know you are, dear little Helen, but be a
good girl. We are going to see grandpa.”</p>

<p>“Is he the grandpa that wouldn’t let us in his
house?” asked Helen, this time hugging closer to
her mother, for the night’s shades brought the
chill winds from the sea.</p>

<p>“He did not know, love, how badly we wanted
to see him, I am sure, or he would not have turned
us away. Now listen, dearest, and you shall have
enough to eat before long.”</p>

<p>This was every word true, but, little Helen
Standish, it would not be in your grandfather’s
mansion that you would eat, but in the awfulness
of a prison house. The poor exhausted mother,
tired and weary, was swept from the street into
the gutter by a heavy truck, and when they picked
her up stunned, the policeman said that she was
drunk, and she was sent to the Island for three
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>While the papers did not give her name, a
small account of the dreadful woman, with her
child at her side, and found drunk in the streets,
gave a slight vision of some of the other half in
New York of whom so little is known by those
living in luxury.</p>

<p>But the description of the child and the woman
and especially the trinket found in the woman’s
fingers, which it was supposed she had stolen,
made George seek Nathans.</p>

<p>“I believe that this woman is that Annie Standish,”
cried he, “and you must find out. I believe
the old man is on his last legs. He will have no
opportunity to see his daughter. Now then, if
this is she, then we must get the child, and do
away with it, and I think the mother has consumption.
Now then, you can work in that little
thief Farren, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Give him a thousand dollars for kidnapping
the child. Buy off some of the guards to allow
him to get away by the river, and then impress
upon his mind that if the child is the same he is<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
to see that it falls into the water. It won’t be
missed. He regains his freedom and a thousand,
and future help if he needs it.”</p>

<p>The pawnbroker thought for a long time.</p>

<p>“What do I get out of all this?” he asked,
squinting his eye at his companion. “I must
know this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll have enough. Don’t fear.”</p>

<p>“Then, tell me now,” said Nathans.</p>

<p>“Five thousand.”</p>

<p>“Five thousand?” ejaculated the broker. “Do
all the dirty work for you and get a paltry five
thousand out of a clean two million? You must
think that I am a fool. I’ve loaned you more than
that in clean cold cash.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I understand that I should return
that also.” The broker walked away.</p>

<p>“I want nothing to do with your scheme.”</p>

<p>“Then, tell me what you do want,” said George
almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Half.”</p>

<p>“Half! My heavens, man, that is a fortune.”</p>

<p>“I know, and you will have one, too. I don’t<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
intend you to get the cream and leave me the skim
milk.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you will drive such a hard bargain,
come back, and half is agreed.”</p>

<p>The broker chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“That is more like it,” said he.</p>

<p>“Then you will see the boy,” asked George as
he pulled his collar up tightly about his neck.</p>

<p>“Yes,” and true to his promise the Jew crossed
the river and presented himself at the prison
door.</p>

<p>“May I see a young man in whom I am interested
by the name of Farren? He was put in for
theft.”</p>

<p>“And a bird he is, too,” said the officer in
charge.</p>

<p>“Let me see, do I know you?” hesitated the
Jew, looking into the officer’s face.</p>

<p>“I guess you do, Mr. Nathans, for I am the man
that took the sailor and Jim from your shop. My
partner is here, too, Arkwright, only he is too
darn nice to live. I wouldn’t want to ask him to
do a job for me if I wanted one done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>And the officer winked his eye laughingly.</p>

<p>After the thick-headed Jew had gotten it
through his brains what it meant, he was glad
that the man had given him this hint, for had he
not come to try to bribe Arkwright, but this timely
hint was enough, so he said:</p>

<p>“If you wanted something done in this burg,
who would you go to?”</p>

<p>“Not to Arkwright,” was the answer, and he
made a very wry face.</p>

<p>“To whom, then?”</p>

<p>“To me.”</p>

<p>“And is it possible for you to allow a prisoner
to escape?”</p>

<p>“If you should buy up my partner also,” said
the man.</p>

<p>“And which one is he?” asked the Jew eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. There now, don’t be in a hurry.
Let me make the proposition to him while you see
the boy. Is it Jim that you want to get out?”</p>

<p>The Jew nodded slightly just as the boy jumped
into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Jim,” said the Jew, holding out his
hand; “how are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much as I please,” replied the lad.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want to leave this place?” and
the Jew looked closely at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t I like to get back to New York!”
cried he sharply. “Just you give me the chance,”
sighed he.</p>

<p>“Well, the chance is yours.”</p>

<p>“How?” gasped the youngster.</p>

<p>“By doin’ exactly as I tell you. Now, don’t get
mixed up with any one else in this game, or they
might mix you up. Understand?”</p>

<p>“I should tink I did, mister. Now, tell me
about it, and no kiddin’.”</p>

<p>A whispered conversation went on while the
bribed guard kept his ears shut, waiting for the
time that money should open them.</p>

<p>“The same day that you were placed in here a
woman was brought here with a child. I want
you to escape and take the kid with you and accidentally
drop it off the boat. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am to kill the kid, is that it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“No, it will kill itself, if you leave it in the
water long enough.”</p>

<p>“Just let it slip off the bark, is that it?” asked
Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it.”</p>

<p>“But, where’s the boat to come from?” asked
Jim, interested in his own safety, “and how much
dough am I to get for this?”</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars and your freedom.”</p>

<p>“Hully Gee, but that would set me up in business.
I guess I’ll take it, mister.”</p>

<p>“Then you are to wait until I send you a chart.
Do you see that man sleeping there? He will aid
you. He says that you have been trying to escape.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dug my way out t’other night, but
found that I was in another cove’s cell. He just
lay there and let me dig and then laughed at me
fer my pains.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Jim; now you can laugh at him
for his pains,” said the Jew.</p>

<p>Inside a little book which the Jew handed, with<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
a show of reverence, to the convict were some fine
files and the like to aid him to escape.</p>

<p>“The warden thinks it’s a prayer book that I
brought you,” said the Jew. “Now hide the things
away, and don’t let any one into your secret.”</p>

<p>Just as they were talking in a low tone the
warden ushered in a woman.</p>

<p>“If it ain’t Biddy Roan, me cousin,” said Jim,
trying to hide his head. “I don’t want her to see
me,” but see him she did, and the good Irishwoman
had to go over the whole death scene of
the poor mother of Jim, who had died since he
came to the prison.</p>

<p>“Now then, Jim,” said she, “if you ever get out
and want to be a good fellow, you just come to my
place of business. I’ve got a house on the river
side, and you’re welcome for your poor mother’s
sake, and you may take care of my boats for the
payment of your board,” and Biddy Roan, who
had been visiting the sick woman upstairs, hurried
out of the prison with tears in her eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Arkwright and his fellow detective, Hammond,
for their clever piece of work in bringing
the sailor to trial for the theft of the jewels, and
the Farren fellow for the pawning of a stolen
watch, were both given higher positions in the
prison at the Island. They were much pleased
with the work, knowing that a higher prestige
was carried with the job. Hammond was a fellow
who could not be trusted, but Arkwright was
the soul of honor, and he had a position next to
that of the warden. In fact, there were strong
talks of making him warden if anything should
happen to the man now in charge.</p>

<p>He was coming down just as Nathans was finishing
his talk with Jim. The Jew heard Arkwright
calling from the stairs.</p>

<p>“You give Mrs. Standish anything she wants.<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
I do not believe she will last long, and if anything
should happen to her suddenly you call me.
Do not let anyone have the little tot until I have
been notified.”</p>

<p>The Jew started as he heard these words.</p>

<p>It meant so much to him, and so much to the
man for whom he was working, as well as the
little mite of a child who was waiting for the
death of its mother in the upper ward.</p>

<p>Little did Annie Standish know that in the
mansion on Fifth avenue that day a great funeral
had been held, and that the father she had hoped
to see had given up his fight, and that George
Benson followed him to his grave as the only
mourner. Little did she realize that a gigantic
scheme was afloat to ruin her child and to make
her life of no value. She was too sick to realize,
even if it had been told her, and could only now
and then open her eyes and look at the good Mrs.
Higgins, who had followed her over, and to
squeeze the red hand of her friend, Biddy Roan.</p>

<p>As Mr. Arkwright left her the good man felt
that she was not long for this world, and that she<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
would leave her child soon, but his heart beat
happily when he thought that for the little one
there were happier days, as there was lots of
money for her, but little Helen was too young to
know what money meant.</p>

<p>As the good Arkwright called out his commands
to the attendants he spied the Jew.</p>

<p>“You here yet?” said he slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been talking to Jim. I hope you
don’t mind. I brought him the prayer book his
mother sent him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t mind, but it’s a new business
for you, that’s all, Nathans.”</p>

<p>“Not so new,” growled the other, a guilty flush
rising to his forehead. “I have always felt for
these poor fellows over here, but have never
known of one before.</p>

<p>“But have you ever heard anything of the
woman you were looking for, the poor one with
a wealthy father?”</p>

<p>“We have,” said Arkwright, rubbing his hands,
“but the mother is ill unto death, and the child
will live to make the best of the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>“Then, its people were rich?” asked the Jew,
his eye shining, as he wanted to be very sure that
the child upstairs was the little heiress. He wanted
to know that he was not paying out a thousand
for nothing. He cared not a picayune if
Jim stayed in prison all the rest of his days, but
he wanted to get the child whose mother was the
daughter of the millionaire Benson, and there
must be no mistake.</p>

<p>“Rich,” replied Arkwright, as he held the large
gate open for the Jew to pass through; “I should
think so. They have more money than they know
what to do with,” and as the Jew walked away
he waggled his beard after the manner of his
race.</p>

<p>“I have you right where I want you, Arkwright,”
said he to himself. “You think that the
child’s life is worth a great deal, and I will show
you that there is no one who can balk me and
George Benson without failing in their plans.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Biddy Roan was with Annie Standish
upstairs there was a pathetic scene. The sick<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
woman had heard the news of her father’s death.
“Biddy,” she said plaintively, “I know that I
shall not live until the morrow. Now, there are
none of my people who care a cent for me or the
child, and I want you to promise me that you will
take my Helen, remember her name is Helen
Standish, and take her with you.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, honey,” soothed the Irishwoman,
“you need not be so worrit over this child, nor
over yourself, for I am a-thinking that you’se is
a-going to get well. But if you’se shouldn’t I will
take your darling to my house, and there will be
no better mother in the world than I will be to
the likes of her.”</p>

<p>Annie Standish smiled faintly, for she knew
this, and had she not had evidence of the goodness
of the woman’s heart?</p>

<p>“Listen, Biddy, until I charge you with something.
My father is dead, and he has left his fortune
to my cousin, so I think. Now then, don’t
you let him know of my child’s existence, for if he
does he may do her some terrible harm.”</p>

<p>“Then he shan’t know of it, honey. Now you<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
just take a good look at the darling and go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>Biddy went to the child’s crib and picked the
little one up in her arms.</p>

<p>“Come and give a kiss to you’se poor mother,
me darlint,” said she softly, “and then you’se can
snooze again to sleep. Now then, be a good girl.”</p>

<p>The little one whined, for sleep had closed her
eyelids and the tired child was worn out with her
prison play.</p>

<p>“Mother’s precious baby,” said the mother
sleepily; “I will hold her, Biddy, for a little
while, for she is so sweet.”</p>

<p>“But it will tire you to death,” cried the Irishwoman.
“Now then, you let me put her back on
her own little bed, and you both try and sleep.”</p>

<p>Biddy crept out and left the mother and child
alone, and as she passed out she muttered a
prayer for the sick woman and for the welfare of
her little child.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Darkness had settled over the prison, and not<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
a sound was heard but the whispering of two
men.</p>

<p>“I got to get this chart of the prison in to Farren
on my beat,” said one, “and then I’m going
to turn in.”</p>

<p>“You had better be careful that you don’t take
his place. It’s worth more than a hundred to do
such a job as this.”</p>

<p>“I know, but when you can’t get no more, what
youse going to do? I tried to raise yours and
mine. Now then, a hundred goes a long ways filling
up seven hungry mouths like I have home.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” retorted the other, and they subsided
into silence.</p>

<p>In a cell a young man was lying as quiet as a
mouse, and his breath was coming in short pants,
as if excitement was overcoming him.</p>

<p>He heard the tramp of feet, and soon a hand
was shoved through his cell bars and a paper was
extended to him.</p>

<p>“Here is the chart. Be careful, and don’t forget
about the baby.”</p>

<p>The long fingers covered over the paper, and<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
the youth lay down again, this time breathing
easier, and he realized that there was much to do
before the morning should dawn. Many a man
had escaped from this place, only to again be
taken by the guards before they could get into
New York.</p>

<p>For a long time he lay thinking, and he could
hear the guards talking in a low tone nearby, but
his heart was even then quickening in its beating,
for another thought had come into his mind.</p>

<p>Once he remembered doing a mean thing to a
fellow being. Stealing from the rich was just in
the sight of Jim, but to do a trick unjust and unkind
was not his way. He knew that this baby
killing was to be the meanest thing of his life.
If it were not for blessed freedom he would back
out in a moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sat up and whispered loudly:</p>

<p>“Tom Cooper.”</p>

<p>All was silent.</p>

<p>“Tom Cooper,” he said, this time a little louder.</p>

<p>Another voice came from the other cell.</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<p>“Listen, for I cannot speak too loudly. I want
to take you out of this place to-night. Do you
want to go?”</p>

<p>There was an evident stir in the opposite cell.</p>

<p>“How can you take me out?” said the voice.</p>

<p>“Here, I will throw you a file, and you cut
through your cell door, and I will do the same,
and I have friends who are going to help me.
Now, don’t wait too long.”</p>

<p>If any one had been listening they would have
heard the distinct buzzing of two tiny files making
their way through the steel bars in the cells
of two convicts.</p>

<p>When the task was over Tom Cooper stood a
free man in the corridor.</p>

<p>“How are we going to leave this place?” asked
Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>“By a boat. I don’t know how to manage one,
but you do, and the river is high. Now then,
we’ve got to run for it. You are not to say a word,
for there is to be but one missing, and I’m letting
you into my good luck, for I’m thinking that you<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
were put in here unjustly, and some day I’ll tell
you all about it.”</p>

<p>Tom was too interested to listen to more, and
he hastily asked the way to the boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, but, listen, somebody is coming.”</p>

<p>Saying this, both jumped into their berths, and
Arkwright ran again through the corridor.</p>

<p>“I could have sworn that I heard voices,” said
he in a whisper. “I suppose I am worried, seeing
that boat, but I think some fisherman has left it
there.”</p>

<p>Tom and Jim had hardly taken a breath until
they heard the re-echoing of the officer’s heavy
boots upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Come now,” he said in a low tone, “let’s get
out of here.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go upstairs,” said Jim slowly, looking
at Tom to see what he would say as to the
revelation he was going to make. “I have a kid
up there, and I’m not going to leave it behind.”</p>

<p>“Your own?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“You bet, ’taint no right in the world,” said
Jim; “but long as ’tis here, and I’m to blame for
it, I’m going to take it along.”</p>

<p>Tom Cooper put out his hand and grasped the
other’s hand in his.</p>

<p>“You’re a dandy,” cried he; “I’m glad to know
you. Hurry and get the kid, or we may be seen.”</p>

<p>“Don’t utter a whisper, and I’ll be down in a
minute. The babe is just above us here. Lucky
I got it to-night, or there would be no chance to-morrow.
I heard they were going to move it to
another building.”</p>

<p>“Hurry then, Jim,” again said the sailor.</p>

<p>Jim could not but wonder how he was going to
explain the drowning of the child, and if the
sailor would take it like he did and think that as
long as his freedom depended upon it it was all
right. Jim hated to do it, but he had promised,
and then, too, the kid was so little.</p>

<p>He hurried up the steps, and looked cautiously
about.</p>

<p>There was the mother lying as if dead upon the
bed, and opposite her was the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>With a sly motion of his hand he slipped a
saturated handkerchief under the child’s nose,
and she slumbered on peacefully.</p>

<p>The mother murmured once, “Helen,” in her
sleep and the convict heard and went on. He
could see the death damp upon the brow of the
mother. He knew that it would not be long before
she would be outside the gates of the immortal
and demanding admittance.</p>

<p>Jim was superstitious and he ran down the
steps as if the devil were in his trail.</p>

<p>The boys thought their troubles were all over,
when they heard a great voice calling them:</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, there are two of you.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Hammond,” snarled Jim, “I’m taking
the father of the kid. Get some more money
from Nathans; he’s good for it.”</p>

<p>Again there was silence.</p>

<p>“Hist, there is another.”</p>

<p>“Who?” called Jim.</p>

<p>“Arkwright.”</p>

<p>“Then we are lost,” cried Jim, lying flat down
upon the baby, and Tom following suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>“Have you seen anyone?” they heard the deep
voice of the guard from the south gate.</p>

<p>“No,” growled Hammond.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose all my worry was for nothing,
but I thought that this boat meant something;
but I think it must belong to some fisherman.”</p>

<p>“Of course it does, for heaven’s sakes go and let
a fellow snooze.”</p>

<p>Arkwright muttered something about not
snoozing on duty and said out loud:</p>

<p>“If I thought that boat meant anything I’d
turn it adrift.”</p>

<p>“And keep some poor fellow upon the Island
all night?” said Hammond, the bribed guard, who
with his mate was watching for fear their little
plan might be noticed.</p>

<p>“Well, that would be mean. I don’t think it
amounts to shucks, so I’ll go along and let you
boys attend to your business.”</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone the convicts were up
and off again and down to the river like two shadows,
and the great gates were closed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>Into the boat tumbled Tom, and he took the
child from his companion’s arms.</p>

<p>“It’s a girl, ain’t it, Jim?” he asked as he
placed it upon the seat still sleeping.</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“How old?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be blest if I know. My memory ain’t no
good, even as far as my kid goes. But I wasn’t
going to leave it behind.”</p>

<p>“I admire you for taking her,” said Tom as he
whirled the boat into the dark night, and the
shadows of the prison walls dropped into the
longer one of the night, and the boys were well
upon their way to freedom.</p>

<p>In the shadow Jim took a card from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Can you read that, pard?” said he just as a
great whistle blew from the prison. But Tom
had been able to see Biddy Roan’s address, and
heard Jim say that she was a good woman and
wanted him to come to her place. But the terrible
thundering of the whistle and the bright
lights upon the shore made the boys put to the
oars with greater grip than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>When they were out of danger Jim commenced
to play about the baby’s neck, mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take this off,” murmured he.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Tom, stopping a moment.</p>

<p>“Going to take this trinket from the child. I
am going to give her a bath.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not to drown her?” said Tom in a terrified
tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, unless she can make her tracks in the
water.”</p>

<p>“Why, no child that age can swim,” said Tom,
again putting his hand upon his companion’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Then her chance isn’t worth what ours is,”
replied Jim brutally.</p>

<p>“You would murder your own child? Oh, man,
I implore you do not do this thing.”</p>

<p>Tom had a tight hold of Jim.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I am going to do it,” cried Jim,
“and you listen here, the price of our freedom is
that we should shut this kid’s wizen, and I promised,<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
and now that I let you in on the game I don’t
expect you to balk me.”</p>

<p>The two were staring at each other through the
awful darkness.</p>

<p>“I swear you shall not kill it,” cried Tom, and
with that the two struggled fiercely together.
Every time Jim came near the baby he tried to
kick it off in the water. But Tom would effectually
keep him far enough away from it.</p>

<p>But Jim gave a peculiar wrench to Tom’s arm,
and the poor fellow was suffering with a dislocated
shoulder. He saw the convict pick up the
baby, and throw it into the water, and then grasp
the oars and row away. From the depths Tom
thought he saw a sweet childish face, and for a
moment he hesitated and then cast himself into
the water.</p>

<p>In an instant he had the child by the arms and
had swung her up onto his back sailor-like and
was making for the shore.</p>

<p>The last that Jim saw of the sailor <a id="BRef_96" href="#Ref_96">he was pulling
with great strokes for land with the child
clinging to his back.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>“Let him go,” muttered the convict, “and may
the black devil go with him, but I’m darned glad
that the kid didn’t die, although I did my prettiest.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p>When Tom realized that he had the child
safely in his arms and was climbing up the rocks
upon the East River his heart beat with delight.
He felt that his freedom was given him that he
might save the little maiden from a death which
she did not merit.</p>

<p>He was repeating over to himself the name of
the widow, Biddy, whom we have met before.</p>

<p>The woman had given the card to Jim, not
knowing that it would fall into the hands of another
convict.</p>

<p>She was sitting, just getting ready for bed, and
muttering to herself: “It does seem strange that
the poor mother has to die in the prison. I suppose,
as she ain’t got no friends, there ain’t no
use sending her into the world. But that’s a
pretty baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>“She ought to be a queen,” Biddy added as she
turned out the light and jumped into bed.</p>

<p>This woman kept a small boathouse, with some
half-dozen boats to rent, and took in small washings
from the sailors upon the tugs in the river,
and from this she made a good living and had
managed to put by a little. She had but one
friend, and that was the venerable Mrs. Higgins,
and it was through the woman on the Island that
these two women had met.</p>

<p>This night Biddy had come late from the
prison, leaving poor Annie Standish nearer the
grave than the good woman thought it possible to
be.</p>

<p>“I will go in the morning again,” said she,
“and I hope the bairn will be in better spirits.”</p>

<p>Then she tumbled over in the bed. Suddenly
she raised her head. She heard a light tapping
upon the window pane, and it seemed almost like
the ticking of a clock.</p>

<p>Biddy listened again. It certainly was a signal
of distress. She went cautiously to the window
and looked out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>There was the shadow of a very tall man, and
he was tapping upon her window.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” cried she loudly, knowing
that no one could hear but the man.</p>

<p>“I want help for a poor wet child,” was the answer,
and Biddy Roan’s door was thrown open,
despite the fact that she stood in her night gown.</p>

<p>Tom Cooper staggered into the room under the
weight of the heavily-breathing child.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” asked Biddy suspiciously,
looking at the prison stripes.</p>

<p>“I will tell you the truth,” and Tom began at
the beginning and told the story from the time he
had had a part in it.</p>

<p>“You see, if I had not saved her, the child
would have been drowned.”</p>

<p>“And Jim Farren was the boy who started to
do this trick. Let me see him again, and I’ll pull
his claws for him.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be bothered with him, I have a notion,”
said Tom, “for he wouldn’t dare to stay
about here.”</p>

<p>Biddy was undressing the wet child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“And I was but telling her dying mother this
day that I would care for her and see that her
cousin did not harm her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have an idea,” said Tom, as he was
shivering with the cold, “that it was this same
cousin who found out about the child and wanted
her out of the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, and now, lad,” and here Biddy looked
at the sailor with pity in her eyes, “what are
you going to do, go back to the Island?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it. I was put in on a false
charge, for a crime I never committed. Now then,
what can you do for me?”</p>

<p>“I can fix you up so that you won’t be known
by your own mother if you had one a-living, but
now you get into this old dress of mine and climb
to the loft and sleep as long as you want to, and I
will see to the child. I’ll throw these old clothes
of yours into the river and let the stripes sink in
the presence of the stars.”</p>

<p>Biddy laughed and Tom re-echoed it, for indeed
he had found a friend. He did as he was
bidden, and the warm feathers felt sweet to the<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
cold body, and the sun had been shining a long
time before Tom Cooper opened his eyes to the
light of day.</p>

<p>When he did come down in the morning he
found a large-eyed child looking into his face.</p>

<p>She was fingering a little locket which Tom
had seen Jim trying to wrench from the baby’s
neck when he went after him, and he picked it up
in his fingers and read:</p>

<p>“To my darling Annie, from her father.”</p>

<p>Then Tom Cooper knew that he stood in the
presence of his benefactor’s grandchild. He took
a solemn oath that he would watch over and care
for her until some one had a better right.</p>

<p>Biddy went to the city that day, leaving the
boathouse closed, and purchased a suit, hat, shoes
and other things needed by a man, and with the
outfit she bought a wig and a set of whiskers.</p>

<p>“You’ll wear these for a long time,” said she
slowly, “for then you won’t give away your identity,
for if you should do that you would be taken
back to the Island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So they lived on and on for many a year. The
little Standish child was no more than a baby
when she was first brought to the boathouse, but
upon this beautiful summer morning when this
story again opens she is sitting upon a porch
swinging in the hammock.</p>

<p>Biddy had arranged the house so that now it
comfortably held three, and Tom had a good position
and came home every night. Often after the
child went to bed the man and woman would
gravely talk over the future of the little girl,
whom they had both grown to love.</p>

<p>She was humming softly to herself, when Biddy
came out and spoke to her.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are thinking about to-morrow,
ain’t you, little one?” began she. “Just think,
you are twenty years old—quite a young lady, I
vow.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m a young lady, auntie,” said the
girl, “but I want Cousin Tom to treat me just the
same. You know if he thought I was too big he
might not take me on his lap.”</p>

<p>Biddy laughed softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, arrah,” said she with a sigh, “if the girl
ain’t in love with that Tom, false whiskers and
all. I wish she could see the beauty of his face
without them, and she would fall in love with him
all over again. Biddy Roan, if you weren’t
everything that’s homely in the world you might
take a turn at love yourself.”</p>

<p>She ironed vigorously, and then went to the
porch again in answer to Helen’s call.</p>

<p>“I say, auntie,” said the girl, “how is Tom my
cousin, on my mother’s side or my father’s?”</p>

<p>“Your mother’s,” said the woman shortly.</p>

<p>“And what——”</p>

<p>“Now don’t you try to pump any secrets out of
me, you sly little fox; you wait until your cousin
comes home; then you ask him. He’s more able
to tell you about yourself than I am.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait, Aunt Biddy,” said the girl.
“Then, if you are my aunt, and Tom is my cousin,
you must be the same relation to him as you are
to me.”</p>

<p>The Irishwoman stared with a love-light shining
in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>“I told you not to worry your little head,” said
she, “for when Tom comes home you can ask him
everything you want to.”</p>

<p>So the girl had to be silent. She swayed softly
to and fro, and after a while she sank into a
sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It might be well while the girl is sleeping and
the quiet summer sun is shining upon a peaceful
river, to go back a while to that night fifteen
years ago when Tom Cooper had saved the child
in the river.</p>

<p>Jim Farren sailed down the stormy river toward
Hell Gate. He was no sailor, but he steered
his boat as best he could. Then for a long time
after he was in the sea, he knew not what to do.
He had not dared to go toward the city, for fear
of being tracked, although he knew that Biddy
would take him in.</p>

<p>But Biddy’s welcome must wait until there was
a better chance of not being detected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>He watched every light, fearing that one might
be a boat to pick up the escaped convicts, who
had long ago been missed.</p>

<p>It was the puffing of a great steamer that made
him rise high in his boat and give screams that
rang over the water. Soon he saw the great
searchlight turn in his direction and then drop.
He hastily skinned off his clothes and dropped
them into the sea. He knew that his head looked
badly, for it had been only so lately shaved. But
this had been his day for a hair cut, so that there
was a little growth upon his head.</p>

<p>Soon he saw a boat lowered, and before time
had elapsed long enough to tell the story, the convict
was in the steamer and nestling in a warm
sailor’s bed, and steaming out for a foreign country.</p>

<p>There was nothing that could have suited Jim
better. When he arose after a few days’ illness
there was no sign of New York and not a shadow
of the walls that had covered him so long.</p>

<p>He did not try to come back to his native city
for fifteen years, and then one day Jim Farren,<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
not much changed in appearance, turned his face
homeward and landed in New York, just one day
before the twentieth birthday of sweet Helen
Standish.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Biddy Roan to-morrow,” said
he to himself as he went along and picked out the
familiar landmarks. “She will be glad to see me
for my mother’s sake. Poor mother, you never
knew that your boy would make his way about
the world like that. I wonder whatever became
of the kid and the cove that saved her. That was
a plucky piece of business on his part. I’d like to
shake hands again just for the sake of old times.”</p>

<p>Saying this, the man entered some of the Bowery
saloons which he had long ago visited and sat
for some hours pouring the whiskey into his stomach.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now Tom Cooper had come home. His heart
was singing in his breast, for had he not a great
deal to live for? He was sure that his little ward<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
loved him in a way. Of course she could not care
for him in the way he did for her, but then, it was
something to feel her smooth white hands upon
his face, and feel her innocent kisses showered
there. He did not find the girl in when he reached
the boathouse. Biddy was making biscuits and
singing.</p>

<p>“You are as happy as I am, Biddy,” said the
man as he put down his oars upon the dock, and
came into the house.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m happy,” replied the woman,
“and why should I not be? Why, Tom, have any
two people any more reason to be happier than
we are? Think of it, Nellie loves us both, and we
are saving money by the quart, and our darling
is a lady.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want her too much of a lady,” said the
man gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t help her being a lady,” stormed
Biddy, “for she is born and bred in the bone a
lady, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, Biddy, that way, I know, but don’t<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
get into her head notions that she must marry a
rich man, will you?”</p>

<p>Then the woman laughed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come out with it, man?” said
she, “and tell me all about it? I know that you
love this girl, and it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Tom’s dark head dropped down upon his hands.
He loved this good Irishwoman, and also the little
girl, just as Biddy had said.</p>

<p>But he was years older than Nellie, and there
were so many finer-looking fellows in the city.
Then, too, there was that stain upon his name
which he could not erase unless he could find the
man who stole the jewels and placed them in his
bundle, and that was so long ago that there was
no possible chance.</p>

<p>Just as they were talking they heard a girlish
laugh. <a id="Ref_109" href="#BRef_109">Nellie had gone out in her own little boat,</a>
which Biddy had given her, and was returning
for supper.</p>

<div id="BRef_109" class="figcenter illowp47" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i138.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#Ref_109">NELLIE</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>Her happy laughter could always be heard before
the girl came in sight.</p>

<p>“Now you tell her, Tom, all about herself,”<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
argued Biddy, “for if you don’t there is no way
for you to ask her to marry you.”</p>

<p>Again the man shuddered.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell her I found her in prison,” said
he, with a very white face, “for then she would
ask me how I came there.”</p>

<p>“Tell her anything, but to-night, if you want
her, is your chance. She has more lovers stringing
here after boats than you can count upon
your fingers and toes.”</p>

<p>Tom stood up with a great resolution.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her now,” said he slowly.</p>

<p>He went out of the house and stood in the sunlit
porch. Just behind the great hill beyond he
could see the last of the sun sinking to rest. His
heart beat with foolish excitement, for he feared
this girl could not love him as he did her.</p>

<p>“Halloa, Tom,” shouted she. “Oh, I’m so glad
you are home. What makes you look so grave?
Oh,” and the girl did not wait for the man’s answer,
“I have had such a daring time. Where do
you think I’ve been, way down to Hell Gate, and
almost went into the rapids.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>By this time she had placed her oars into the
boat and clasped the chain firmly in its staple.</p>

<p>The man’s face grew white as he heard these
words.</p>

<p>“My heavens, Nellie, you must not go to such
dangerous parts of the river. You might have
been killed.”</p>

<p>“Would you have cared very much, Tom?” said
Nellie, stopping and holding her hands out; “I
want my dear ones to care very much.”</p>

<p>The man’s answer for an instant was to crush
the white hands in his and draw the girl close to
him.</p>

<p>“Would I care, Helen Standish?” cried he,
leading her into the house. “More than I can tell
you. Let’s have our supper, and then I’ve got a
story to tell you.”</p>

<p>“One of your fairy stories, Tom?” laughed the
girl. “I always liked them when I was a little
girl, and what a wilful child I was, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>“You were a sweet child, Nellie,” said Tom,
“and now Biddy is calling saying that her biscuits
will be cold if we don’t go to supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>The meal was hardly over before Nellie broke
out: “What makes you people so awfully quiet
to-night? Is it your fairy story, Cousin Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the story he’s got to tell you, Nellie,”
commented Biddy.</p>

<p>“Tom is one of those chaps who wants to think
a long time before he leaps.”</p>

<p>“But I’m ready to leap now, Biddy,” replied
Tom appealingly, “and I cannot have more
than——”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I’ll go,” replied Biddy, with her
head up very high, “but I’m coming in when you
takes the leap. It’ll take you an hour to get
ready.”</p>

<p>But Tom was not listening to Biddy’s chatter.
He was looking deep into Nellie’s eyes, and the
girl felt in her heart that something was coming,
that there would be a change in her life after to-day.</p>

<p>She bowed her head upon Tom’s hands as she
saw the color creep into his face and mount high
to his forehead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>For a long time there could be nothing heard
but the ticking of the clock, and the loud breathing
of Nellie’s pet cat, in whose soft fur the girl
had entwined her fingers. The other hand was
enclosed in Tom’s.</p>

<p>“I am not your cousin, Nellie,” he said deliberately
after a while.</p>

<p>“Not my cousin? Then who are you, and who
am I?” This startled exclamation brought the
tears to the man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” Nellie added as she saw that Tom
was not answering, “I’ve treated you just like my
cousin, kissed you many times, and——”</p>

<p>“I hope you will kiss me many times again,”
said Tom, his tones having taken on a deepness
which caused the tender face of the girl to flood
with color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“But I want to be a relation to you, Tom,
dear,” cried the girl sharply.</p>

<p>“And so you shall, darling,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” was the satisfied reply.
“Now go on with the—the—fairy story, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Then once upon a time——”</p>

<p>And here Tom stopped. How was he going to
describe that dreadful prison without telling her
all about it? His pride forbade that.</p>

<p>“Well, once upon a time,” answered Nellie impatiently.</p>

<p>“There was once a beautiful island——”</p>

<p>And again Tom paused.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember it,” cried Nellie. “It was all
ivy windows, with shutters, iron shutters, and—and——”
Here she rubbed her forehead and
added: “A great stone wall all about it; is that
what the castle was, Tom?”</p>

<p>Biddy had ventured back. By the terrible expression
upon Tom’s face she feared he would
tell the whole story.</p>

<p>“That’s it, darling, that’s it. I remember the
castle myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>Tom drew a long sigh as he had passed the only
breaker safely thus far.</p>

<p>“It was a very hard castle to get into,” ventured
Nellie as if struggling for a better memory.</p>

<p>“But a worse place to get out of,” said Biddy
with a poke at Tom’s ribs.</p>

<p>He gave her a dreadful look and he went on
hastily.</p>

<p>“There was a beautiful little girl brought to
this island, and that child was you, my Helen.”</p>

<p>Tom was leaning over the table and looking
into Helen’s eyes.</p>

<p>The startled expression hurt him much, for he
feared the girl would call to her mind what kind
of a castle they were living in, but without a word
she put out her slender arms and drew the dark
head down to her lips.</p>

<p>“There’s a sweet kiss, Tom.”</p>

<p>Biddy smacked her lips suspiciously, as she
always had to do something. She did not want
to cry, and Tom did look so solemn.</p>

<p>“Then I lived there in that island?” asked
Helen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was there anybody living there beside us?”</p>

<p>The question was so innocent and sweet that
Tom thought his heart would break, and Biddy
again came to his rescue.</p>

<p>“Anybody else? Well, I should think so. I
was there half the time myself. And there were
more people on that beautiful island than you’d
ever expect to see in such a small island again.”</p>

<p>Tom looked reproachfully at Biddy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he slowly, “I lived there myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you now?” laughed Nellie, “and I did,
too. Wasn’t it romantic?”</p>

<p>“Very,” replied Tom, giving a dreadful look at
Biddy.</p>

<p>“What did you do there, Tom?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>This was hard to get over, but Biddy, with her
Irish wit, was not to be stumped in such a matter.</p>

<p>“Sure, me darlint, he worked for the government.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure that was a lovely position, for I
often see the soldiers go by, and they work for the
government, don’t they, Tom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>This was too much. Tom groaned in spirit, but
again Biddy came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Tom always groans when he thinks of how
near you got killed over there, don’t you, Tom?”</p>

<p>The man bowed his head. Biddy was a darling
anyway.</p>

<p>“Then do hurry and tell me how I came with
you, and who my father is and my mother, for I
will know, Tom.”</p>

<p>“And so you shall, my darling Helen, you shall
know.”</p>

<p>“One dark night I left the island with another
fellow——”</p>

<p>Tom could not go on, and Biddy took up the
thread.</p>

<p>“And the bold, bad boy had you in his arms,
and our Tom saw him trying to throw you in the
water, and when he did it Tom jumped in
after——”</p>

<p>Nellie stood up with a cry.</p>

<p>“I remember it all,” said she slowly, “all about
the island, a sick woman, and you taking me from
the water. That was nice, Tom, the way you<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
crawled up the rock with me clinging to your
back.”</p>

<p>The man made no answer, and Nellie went
around and took his hands in hers.</p>

<p>“I’m your girl forever, ain’t I, Tom? I want to
always be with you. Are you telling me this
story so as to send me away from you to my relatives?”</p>

<p>There was a pathos in the girl’s voice that
wrung the tears from her listeners. Tom did not
reply for a moment.</p>

<p>Nellie turned quickly to Biddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Biddy, who is going to have me? I want
to stay with you and Tom.”</p>

<p>She dropped upon a chair, and Tom Cooper regained
his voice.</p>

<p>“God forbid, my darling,” cried he, “that you
should ever be with any one in the world but your
own Tom and Biddy. No, little Helen Standish,
you have no relatives to whom Biddy and I will
ever give you. You belong alone to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad—oh, so happy,” and the girl<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
rubbed her face against the whiskers without
which she had never known her Tom.</p>

<p>“And now I am going to place something about
your neck which was yours many years ago, this
little locket which was your mother’s.”</p>

<p>Helen Standish took the trinket, and lifted it
tenderly to her lips.</p>

<p>“I’ve never known another mother but you,
Biddy, and no other friend but Tom, but pardon
me if I weep for my dead mother.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and walked away toward
the window, where the night shadows were falling.
Her heart beat gratefully for these two
good people who had taken her into their lives
and home.</p>

<p>“Tom,” she began without looking at him, “I
can remember many times I have been naughty
and seemed ungrateful to you, but will you believe
that all my life I have loved you better than
any one else?”</p>

<p>There was the big Irishwoman waiting for her
turn, and her little sob drew Nellie’s attention.</p>

<p>“And you, too, my own Biddy. I do not deserve<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
all you have done for me. I have always
meant to be a good girl, but have failed miserably.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, my pretty darlint,” sobbed Biddy,
“don’t you go and make your hearties cry. We
both loves you, and there ain’t nothing to forgive,
is there, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” and then such a longing came
over him that his heart seemed suffocated, and he
wanted to take the girl in his arms and press her
to his bosom, and something in his face seemed to
tell the girl of his wish.</p>

<p>“Say it, Tom,” whispered she, oblivious of
Biddy’s presence.</p>

<p>“I love, I love you, my own darling, and I want
you to be my own little wife.”</p>

<p>They looked into each other’s eyes solemnly,
and Biddy crept to a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>Nellie walked to her lover and laid her hands
in his.</p>

<p>“I shall count it one of the greatest honors of
my life to be your wife,” said she, “and I love you,
Tom Cooper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>Then they talked, Biddy leaving them alone,
and Tom explained everything save that the
island was a prison. Her mother was given the
highest of eulogies.</p>

<p>“I knew her when she was a little girl, although
she was older than I. I loved her very
dearly. Now then, you have one second cousin
living, but your mother did not want to have him
ever see you, or to let him know of your existence.
He has the fortune which you ought to have.”</p>

<p>“My fortune?” asked Nellie wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” and slowly the girl understood why this
same cousin should want to get her out of the
way and should want to kill the little child who
had never done him any harm.</p>

<p>As they were finishing their love-making Biddy
came in with a great noise.</p>

<p>“If you children won’t mind,” said she, giving
Tom a wink, “I’m going to bed; I’m so tired.”</p>

<p>“We won’t mind, will we, Tom?” put in Nellie;
“I’ve a great deal to say to Tom before I go to
bed.”</p>

<p>Biddy, with a yawn, went to her room, saying,<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
as she closed the door: “Now, don’t sit up all
night, my children.”</p>

<p>It amused Nellie to hear Biddy call Tom a
child, for he was many years her own senior, and
there could not be over a few years between her
lover and Biddy.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to bed as soon as the sun goes down,”
laughed Tom.</p>

<p>In fact it was dark, but Biddy had always had
the habit of going to bed so early and getting up
at an unusual hour that Tom was always making
sport of her.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you something, Tom,” said
Nellie, after Biddy’s door was tightly closed.
“What makes you wear those long whiskers?
Most men shave them off, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Tom thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s habit,” said he slowly. He
wished he could take them off and show her the
handsome face beneath, but he could not, for it
would require an explanation about wearing the
grizzly hair upon his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I do not care,” replied Nellie,<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
“for I love you just the same, but I just wondered;
that’s all.”</p>

<p>For a long time they were silent. They were
each whispering to their own heart what a happiness
had been found.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A man slouched along close to the river. His
hat was on one side, and his hands were in his
pockets.</p>

<p>Every boathouse he came to he read the name
upon the top, as evidently he was looking for
some one.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped before an unusually
pretty house, with the boathouse below.</p>

<p>“Biddy Roan,” he read on the sign.</p>

<p>“The old dear lives here,” said he out loud.
“Oh, I know she will be glad to see me again after
all these years for my mother’s sake, if not for
my own.”</p>

<p>Then he knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Who is there, do you suppose, Tom?” asked
Nellie softly; “it is late for any one to come for
boats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but we will soon find out.”</p>

<p>He went to the door, and opened it, when a man
stepped in, but halted as he saw a beautiful girl
standing there.</p>

<p>“Does Biddy Roan live here?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, may I see her? Tell her an old friend
has come back from abroad and wants to see her.
Will you tell her, cove?”</p>

<p>“Let me,” whispered Nellie, and she went to the
bedroom door. But before she opened it she heard
an ejaculation from Tom’s lips.</p>

<p>The stranger was staring at her lover with a
crafty expression in his eyes, while Tom was looking
like death.</p>

<p>She did not say a word to Biddy, but ran back
to Tom.</p>

<p>“What is it? Do you know this man, dear
Tom?”</p>

<p>“I once knew him, Nellie,” said Tom, eyeing his
former companion with an expression of hatred.</p>

<p>Had not this same sneaky fellow almost killed<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
his darling? Had he not taken the dainty child
fresh from its mother’s bosom and thrown it into
the water?</p>

<p>“Tom Cooper!” he was heard to mutter.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Tom Cooper, and you are——”</p>

<p>“Jim Farren. Don’t bother to wake Biddy to-night,
but tell her her cousin called to see her, a
cousin on our mother’s side.”</p>

<p>With this he gave a horrid laugh and sped out
of the door, and Tom sank down upon a seat, and
his heart felt in his bosom like a lump of lead.</p>

<p>“Who is that man?” asked Nellie pointedly.</p>

<p>“He is the man who threw you from the boat,
and, Nellie, if he should come to-morrow while I
am away and they ask you to go with them, would
you go? I knew he recognized you, for he looked
hard at the locket on your neck. He tried to steal
it from you that night in the river.”</p>

<p>Helen Standish showed her force of character
as she took Tom’s large head in her hands and
kissed him.</p>

<p>“I would no more think of leaving you, Tom,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
than I would to leave Biddy, nor half as quick,
for you are going to be my husband, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nellie, those words make me so happy, but
what if they should offer you a great fortune?”</p>

<p>“Without you, my darling, I would not take it,
for I want only this little family circle. Don’t
worry about that, you cannot get rid of your
sweetheart so easy.”</p>

<p>“God forbid that anything like that should ever
happen.”</p>

<p>Then they left each other, and little Nellie,
with a happy, singing heart, crawled in beside
Biddy.</p>

<p>But not so with Tom Cooper. He could see
close to him a great shadow rising before him,
and could feel the shiver of the cold bracelets
about his hands.</p>

<p>Of course, this fiend would tell George Benson
where he was, and what would there be left for
him but to finish out a term in prison, but there
was a possibility that Biddy would know some
way out of the trouble.</p>

<p>He opened his bedroom door cautiously at the<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
first peep of day, and there stood Biddy in her
night clothes.</p>

<p>“Biddy,” whispered Tom, “did Nellie tell you
about the man that came here last night?”</p>

<p>“No, sure she didn’t, I was asleep when she
came to bed.”</p>

<p>“Jim Farren was here.”</p>

<p>“Bad cess to him,” cried Biddy, “what in the
devil’s name did he want now? I thought he was
dead.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” commented Tom.</p>

<p>“But you needn’t be afraid of him,” said Biddy
consolingly. “He won’t dare peach on you, for
that would bring him into trouble, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he will,” replied the man, “for he did
not get the reward which was to have been his at
the death of the child. Now if he can get her into
the villain’s hands he will get the amount which
was coming to him.”</p>

<p>“Now you are worrying over nothing, Tom. Be
cheerful, and we will go to some other place, for
this ain’t the only home in the world.”</p>

<p>“But, Biddy,” argued Tom, “you cannot give<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
up your home for my sake, and you have spent
the best of your days here.”</p>

<p>He had come near the woman then, and they
were looking into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t care fer that,” said she, “and if you
think you and Nellie’s a-going away and leave
this poor Biddy Roan, then youse is mistaken.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, my own Biddy,” ejaculated
Tom. “Then this morning we three will pack our
things and we’ll go away, and if Nellie has to
know the truth then will I tell her.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p>The night before, when Jim Farren recognized
the man and the girl, he was delighted, and he
argued to himself that no harm could come to
him while he had such influential friends as
Nathans and Benson, and that if he got into trouble
they would extricate him. He hurried along
with his hands still in his pockets.</p>

<p>“It’ll be me chance to get even wit’ this cove for
cheating me out of the money, only that I’m glad
that der goil ain’t dead, and she is a sweet-looking
piece of humanity.”</p>

<p>But there was no compunction in his heart as
he said this. He had no scruples in breaking up
a beautiful home now, taking a warm-hearted
lover from his sweetheart. Especially should this
man have been anxious for Tom to escape, knowing<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
that he was innocent, but Tom had taken
away his chances of a fortune and a business.</p>

<p>He made his way to the fashionable quarter of
the city, and rang the bell at the Benson mansion.
It was a long time before there was an answer,
and then the butler put his head outside.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Benson in?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“No,” and before he could ask when he would
be in, the door was slammed and locked in his
face.</p>

<p>Then he pondered what he would do. Of course
Tom Cooper would try and get away, and he
would take the girl with him, and there was a fortune
for her in the will of her grandfather.</p>

<p>Thinking this, Jim thought there was no time
to lose, so he went to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Is this the police headquarters?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is there a man there by the name of Arkwright?”</p>

<p>“Yes; do you want to talk with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead, there’s his wire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>

<p>“Arkwright, is this you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, this a fellow that knows where there is
an escaped convict.”</p>

<p>“Who? And who are you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind who I am, but you just watch the
boathouse of Biddy Roan, on the river. Tom
Cooper is there with the Standish girl, whose
mother died in prison.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so,” cried the detective. “Have
you been to see Mr. George Benson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the cove ain’t in. Now then, what
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Ask you to come here and go with me to Mr.
Benson’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must promise not to ask me any
questions about myself,” said Jim, “or else I
won’t come.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. You put me on the track of that
girl, and I’ll make you all right.”</p>

<p>So Jim went to police headquarters, thinking
he was doing a great stroke of business, and it<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
was late in the night when Arkwright called up
the Benson mansion.</p>

<p>“I want to speak with Mr. Benson.”</p>

<p>“He has retired.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, call him to the wire. I want to
speak with him. This is the police headquarters.”</p>

<p>George Benson responded immediately to the
call.</p>

<p>“This is Arkwright. May I call upon you at
your home immediately? I have found trace of
your cousin, Helen Standish.”</p>

<p>When the detective did come in answer to Benson’s
reply in the affirmative, he found the rich
man pale with fright. The fifteen years that had
passed had whitened the locks about his forehead,
and his eyes had taken upon them a crafty expression,
and no one could ever hold their attention
long at a time.</p>

<p>“Maybe you are mistaken,” said he when Jim
Farren gave the history of his call upon his
Cousin Biddy.</p>

<p>“I’d know that girl by the jewel about her
neck,” said the thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” stubbornly replied Benson.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I am going to investigate this
matter,” said Arkwright, “and if she is there you
will be relieved of your burden in taking care of
her fortune.”</p>

<p>Benson’s face darkened, as he was just beginning
to think it time to apply to the court to
make the money over to him as the next heir, but
now there would be another delay. If this little
fool of a convict had only come to him before going
to the police there would have been a chance
to silence the girl forever if it proved that she was
living, but with Arkwright on the trail Benson
would dare to do nothing.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he asked tremblingly.</p>

<p>“Be there at the peep of day and arrest this
Tom Cooper and place Helen Standish in your
hands, as the law left you her guardian.”</p>

<p>Benson drew a long breath. What could he
want more? His conscience troubled him so that
he thought everybody knew of his evil intentions.<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
He breathed again peacefully and said with a
genial smile:</p>

<p>“You could not please me more than to bring
my cousin to me, and I shall be glad to make a
statement of her fortune to her.”</p>

<p>“We all know you have done your best, Mr.
Benson,” said the detective, “and I hope that you
will have many a happy day with your relation.
You will go with me in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think I will have Mr. Nathans there
to identify the sailor, as you know the goods were
taken to his place to pawn.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll leave that with you.”</p>

<p>There was after that a long conversation over
the ’phone between Benson and Nathans.</p>

<p>The Jew agreed to come in the morning and
meet the trio, and he would swear away the freedom
of Tom Cooper.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Nellie turned uneasily upon her bed. It had
been her custom for many years to sleep late in<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
the morning, Biddy refusing to break the slumber
of “the sweet young thing,” and telling Tom when
he argued that it was for the girl’s good that she
should be made to work, that it was the place of
an Irish Biddy to do hard work, and that Nellie
should sleep.</p>

<p>But this morning she could not rest. She
heard the whispering and talking between her
two friends outside, so she got up and dressed
just as Tom was taking a lot of papers from an
old trunk.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Tom?” asked she curiously.</p>

<p>Tom raised his head and the girl hardly recognized
her lover.</p>

<p>“Something has happened to you,” she ejaculated.
“I know, Tom; don’t shake your head at
me.”</p>

<p>“We are going away from here, Nellie,” said he
hoarsely, “you, Biddy and I.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because we have enemies who are going to<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
take you from us. There, don’t look frightened,
but we are afraid of your cousin.”</p>

<p>“How can he take me if I do not want to go?”
asked Nellie.</p>

<p>“The law might say that you should go,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear them say that I was to leave
you and Biddy.”</p>

<p>“Tom, now don’t scare that child. You’re not
going from us; get on your things, for you and
Tom are to go before me.”</p>

<p>Hardly had these words escaped from Biddy’s
lips before there was a knock at the door, and the
Irishwoman saw the red face of her cousin peeping
in at the door.</p>

<p>“You nasty spalpeen,” cried she, trying to make
a grab for his head, “what are youse doing here?
Get out wid youse.”</p>

<p>“I have some friends with me, Biddy, calling
upon Mr. Cooper, and the pretty young lady.”</p>

<p>“Nellie, will you go in the bedroom, dear?”
asked Tom, but the detective raised his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>“I want the young lady to remain. What I
have to say is of great importance to her.”</p>

<p>Nellie looked mystified, and Benson was gazing
with his soul in his eyes at the pretty face. There
was a sweetness about her that made him think
of her mother, and there was also something that
made him acknowledge to himself that he should
some time love this girl.</p>

<p>“What have you to say to Miss Standish?” began
Tom Cooper, with a sickening feeling at his
heart.</p>

<p>“She is the granddaughter of the dead millionaire
Benson, and this gentleman here is her
cousin. You are one of the greatest heiresses in
New York, my dear young lady.”</p>

<p>The detective bowed low before Nellie, but still
the mystified expression remained in the deep
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“And this gentleman,” said Arkwright sarcastically,
coming nearer Tom, “is an escaped convict,
whom I shall have to ask to accompany me
to the station house.”</p>

<p>Light seemed to break upon Nellie’s mind, but<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
she strenuously denied the charge, keeping a
tight hold of her lover.</p>

<p>“You have made a mistake,” cried she. “Tom
never did a wrong thing in his life, and I am
going to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“But you cannot, my dear Miss Standish; you
are a minor, and cannot have your own way for a
whole year yet.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I am going to be his wife, am I
not, Tom? Tell me that they have made a mistake,
and that you are not what they are trying
to prove you.”</p>

<p>The man did not speak.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Tom, was that island in the fairy
story—was that Blackwell’s Island?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>This one word fell from the man’s lips as if all
hope had left him, and he knew that they would
tear from him his darling, and that he would
spend the rest of his days in prison.</p>

<p>Benson now came forward, trying to take Nellie’s
hand in his.</p>

<p>“My dear little cousin, you cannot again be<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
taken from me. I have searched the city for you,
and now you shall take your position in life, and
be the rich girl you ought to be.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to go with you,” said she mournfully.</p>

<p>“But you must.”</p>

<p>“I will not.”</p>

<p>The more she contemplated the step the more
she shuddered, and she did not intend that Tom
should be taken from her.</p>

<p>“Miss Standish, listen to me,” and Arkwright
went close to her; “now the law has left you in
the charge of your cousin. Mr. George Benson
was left by the terms of your grandfather’s will,
the one trustee who should look after you personally.
I suppose if he had known that you did not
want to be with him your relative would have
changed his wishes, but now that he is dead you
will have to be satisfied with the arrangements,
and as far as this man is concerned,” pointing to
Tom, “I know him to be an escaped convict, and I
shall have to ask him to accompany me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“I am this young lady’s guardian,” put in Tom
obstinately.</p>

<p>“Self-appointed,” sneered Arkwright, “but that
will not hold. Then, too, you will be in a cell before
night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, Tom, tell me all about it, sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“I will, Nellie, and remember what I am telling
you is as true as my love for you. I was arrested
for a crime which I did not commit. I did not
steal your grandfather’s jewels, and that man
knows it.”</p>

<p>He brought out the last words with a jerk, and
pointed his finger at Benson.</p>

<p>George started toward him, but Arkwright detained
him.</p>

<p>“I believe you, Tom,” said Nellie simply, “and
as long as I live I shall believe you are innocent.”</p>

<p>“But that will not prevent your going with
your cousin.” The detective said this as he fastened
the bracelets upon Tom’s wrists.</p>

<p>“I won’t go unless Biddy can go, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>“Well, she cannot,” said Benson, looking crossly
at the Irishwoman.</p>

<p>“Then, I stay right here. Do you understand?
And I would like to see any law drag a girl
twenty years old to a place that she simply won’t
go. Now, gentlemen, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>This was a sticker, and George Benson and the
detective talked in low tones, while Nellie placed
her arms about her lover’s neck.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, Tom, about going, for you
won’t be there long. Now then, when you go
away you are to write to me every day, and I will
to you, and just as soon as I find a good lawyer
you shall be free.”</p>

<p>“We have decided to allow you to take your
friend Biddy with you for a while,” said the detective
affably, “if, when Mr. Benson finds a lady
of your own rank, you will be satisfied to allow
this woman to go.”</p>

<p>Nellie plumped herself down again in her
chair.</p>

<p>“I won’t agree to any such thing. Biddy’s
been my mother for years, and if Mr. Benson<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
doesn’t want her in his house, then I won’t go. I
don’t want a lady of any different rank than myself,
and Biddy is my choice. So there.”</p>

<p>Tom smiled at her from his corner, and the
sight made Benson furious.</p>

<p>Again the two gentlemen conferred, while
Nathans took it upon himself to argue with the
girl.</p>

<p>“Look a-here, Mr. Jew,” cried Nellie, “you just
mind your business. No one has asked you to live
with my Biddy, and Mr. Benson needn’t live with
us either. If I have all the money you say I have
then I can make a home for Biddy and me until I
can get my Tom out.”</p>

<p>Again George ground his teeth. He would soon
make this girl realize that he was her guardian,
and he would commence right then.</p>

<p>“Helen, there will be a time in your life when
you won’t want to associate with these people,
and then you will be glad that I insisted that you
come unencumbered into your beautiful home.
You may bring Biddy with you for a while, but
please do not think of that man again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>He pointed at Tom with his white index finger,
and the girl’s eyes followed in that direction.</p>

<p>The expression of pain that crossed her lover’s
face hurt the girl’s heart. She slipped down at
his feet, and placed her arms about him.</p>

<p>“Tom, I love you; don’t you let those beasts of
men make you believe otherwise. What are you
doing?”</p>

<p>“Taking off this,” and saying these words, the
young fellow pulled his false whiskers and mustache
from his face.</p>

<p>“Well, my soul, Tom, how very handsome you
are!” cried Nellie. “If I had known this before
I would have taken several peeps at you as you
are now.”</p>

<p>“We have heard enough rot,” ejaculated Benson.
“Now, young lady, when will you come to
my home?”</p>

<p>“To her home, you mean, Benson,” corrected
the detective.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the difference? I shall stay with
her until she is married, and maybe she will be
satisfied to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>The rest of the words were lost to Tom, but he
imagined what they were, and his cheek flushed
and the blood seemed to burn his life away.</p>

<p>As Arkwright was placing the hat upon the rearrested
convict, Tom turned to Jim:</p>

<p>“I suppose you did not tell your aunt about
this affair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, sir, and because I told on you and
the girl, I got scot free, sir.”</p>

<p>“Scat,” cried Bridget, “or I’ll pull your
scraggy hair out of your little impudent head,
you dirty spalpeen.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nellie, taking Tom’s hand in hers
as he was being taken away, “I wish you all to
understand that here stands a girl whom you say
is worth a million dollars. There stands a man
whom I love. I shall spend every one of those
millions of dollars to prove him innocent, and
then we can come back here to live with Biddy
after he is out of prison and we are married.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p>It seemed to take all the life out of poor Tom
when he found himself being taken back to
prison. While he had perfect faith in Nellie, still
he hated the evil influence of her cousin. But he
did not yet know the girl who loved him, and did
not realize that no influence in the world could
make her untrue to him.</p>

<p>He went moodily into the same cell that he was
placed in before, this time hoping that his darling
would be true to him.</p>

<p>The morning at last arrived when Nellie
should leave the boathouse that had sheltered her
so long.</p>

<p>She was arranging her hair slowly when Biddy
said: “Are you very sure, me darlint, that you
want your old Biddy with you in youse elegant
home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>Nellie dropped the hair which had twined
about her fingers, and looked at her foster mother.</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t go with me, then I won’t go
either,” and Nellie sat down and commenced to
cry.</p>

<p>“There, there, honey,” soothed the woman.
“Don’t you take on so; your Biddy would follow
you to the ends of the earth. But I don’t want
you to be ashamed of me.”</p>

<p>“That I could never be,” said Nellie, “and when
Tom gets out of prison, then we’ll all go abroad,
for I shall have enough money for all of us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m delighted to be with me darlint,” replied
Biddy. “I only hope you can find a lawyer
who will help you get poor Tom out.”</p>

<p>“I meant what I said,” averred Nellie later,
while thinking deeply, “that I would spend my
last cent to get him free.”</p>

<p>“And may your efforts be blessed by heaven,”
sighed Biddy.</p>

<p>“I am constantly praying,” said Nellie, “that I
will be shown some way to aid him. Don’t you
see the poor fellow is so helpless shut there in<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
that cell, and although I am going to see him, I
know that I shall be broken-hearted to come away
without him.”</p>

<p>As they were speaking, a beautiful span of
horses and a liveried driver drove to the boathouse.</p>

<p>“Is this Miss Standish?” asked the servant. “I
was sent for you and Miss Biddy.”</p>

<p>The haughty nose of the coachman turned up
slightly as he said this, and Nellie noticed it, and
she vowed inwardly that the man’s place should
be filled by another more worthy before long. Already
the determined Nellie had taken the reins
in her own hands.</p>

<p>“I must take my cat,” said she at the last minute,
and when Biddy demurred, saying that the
man driving the carriage might not be pleased
with a cat in the beautiful carriage, she broke out
and said:</p>

<p>“Then let him lump it if he don’t like it. I’ll
take my cat if I want to and not ask my servant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nellie,” gasped Biddy, “don’t call that<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
lovely man a servant. He really looks so handsome
and dignified.”</p>

<p>“He won’t long if I sic Tabby on him. Would
you like to see her scratch at that wool?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Nellie,” begged Biddy; “there, come
now, and we’ll climb in.”</p>

<p>The old boathouse was closed until Biddy
should have a chance to rent it, and she turned
the key in the lock with a sigh, as for years she
had made this place her home.</p>

<p>The carriage bowled gently down through the
streets, and Helen Standish tripped up the steps
from which, when a child, she and her mother
were turned away, but the beautiful girl now going
to take up her own, remembered nothing of
the starvation her poor little mother had gone
through with. All of her days had been spent in
bliss and happiness, with this same old Irishwoman
sitting sedately beside her, with the
Tabby in her arms.</p>

<p>“I am here to greet you,” said George Benson
as he led the girl into her future home. “I am so
pleased that you are where you belong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>But this girl would not have believed this story
had she seen this man when he was alone in his
room. His face was pale and shadowed with
care.</p>

<p>“If I can only make her understand that she
must not consult any lawyer, but allow me to
manipulate her affairs it will be all right, but the
moment she demands a settlement I’ll do away
with her, for it will be my only salvation. I wonder
if she would marry me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Well, how do you like this room?” asked Nellie
of Biddy in an upper bed-chamber, ushering
her foster mother through half a dozen rooms and
halting at the last one. “I suppose they think
I’m going to sleep alone, but I’ll give them to
understand that I won’t. What’s the use of being
rich if one cannot do as they wish to?”</p>

<p>“And you don’t love your old Biddy less for all
the money you have, me darlint?” cried the
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed I do not,” said Nellie; “the only thing
concerns me now is my dear Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll get him out all safe,” said the
woman; “don’t you worry about that.”</p>

<p>“Well, how can I help it,” asked Nellie, “when
I know that dear fellow is languishing over on
that Island for something he did not do? Now
then, Biddy, did you ever see any man look as
handsome as he did when he took off those whiskers?
The horrid things; I never knew how they
disfigured him until I had seen him without
them.”</p>

<p>“Aye, he is a beauty,” added Biddy. “I knew
that you would admire him. Now, darlint, tell
me where I shall hang my bonnet. I don’t know
what to do in these big rooms.”</p>

<p>“Oh, put it anywhere, Biddy,” cried the girl,
looking about. “So this used to be my mother’s
room. I am going to see if there is anything that
ever belonged to her about.”</p>

<p>For hours the young girl searched among the
several rooms which her cousin had told her belonged<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
to her mother, when suddenly she came
upon a little closet tightly locked.</p>

<p>With a set of keys which she had found she
opened it, and before her glistening eyes were a
number of things which evidently belonged to a
little girl.</p>

<p>A broken French doll, with one eye gone, grinned
at Nellie from the corner. In a chair in the
middle of the small room was another doll made
of rags, and it still showed signs of childish teeth.</p>

<p>The long stringy hair which hung over the dirty
face brought the tears to Helen’s eyes. She sat
down upon the floor and began to cry.</p>

<p>“Why, darlint,” cried Biddy, “and you are
a-crying. I wouldn’t look at them little things if
they make your heart ache. Come to your Biddy’s
heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Biddy, Biddy, I can’t help but cry over
my mother. I wish she had lived and been with
us. Oh, how hard fate was to her when she had
such a home as this to die in a dreadful prison.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, it must have been the Good Father’s
wish,” cried the woman, “or it would not<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
have happened. Now, cheer up, dear, and be
happy.”</p>

<p>“But, look at this little doll,” said the girl sorrowfully;
“she must have loved this one, for she
has used it so much.”</p>

<p>“So she has, sweet, but she did not want her
own little girl to cry over it.”</p>

<p>“But she didn’t have any nice mother like you,
dear,” said Nellie.</p>

<p>“Just in this great house all alone with her
father. A girl needs a mother, Biddy.”</p>

<p>“Aye, so they do, and I thank heaven it was
given to me to be one to you, my sweety.”</p>

<p>“And you have been more than that to me,”
whispered the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, Biddy, if I only had my Tom now, I would
be the happiest girl in the world.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go and see a good lawyer,
and maybe he will help you to get him out?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who to go to.”</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t ask Mr. Benson either,” said
Biddy with a curious wink of her eye. “You remember
what Mr. Tom said, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“Blaming my cousin for his arrest?”</p>

<p>“That’s it; he was to blame for the lad’s trouble.”</p>

<p>“You need not fear, Biddy, that I shall go to
him, for he has done enough harm.”</p>

<p>At this moment the servant came to the door,
and said: “Mr. Benson would like to see Miss
Standish in the library.”</p>

<p>Nellie found her cousin sitting, looking very
glum, at the side of the writing table.</p>

<p>“You sent for me?” asked she with dignity.</p>

<p>“I did. Be seated.”</p>

<p>She waited, before speaking again, for him to
proceed.</p>

<p>“You are a very young girl to have the responsibility
of so much money.”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Nellie quickly, “and that is
the reason why I miss Tom so much. He never
has allowed me to have any responsibility.”</p>

<p>Her companion bit his lip ferociously, and the
sight gave Nellie intense delight.</p>

<p>“He will be of no service to you, my dear, for
many years to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>It was Nellie’s turn to bite her lip, for she knew
the truth of his statement.</p>

<p>“I cannot reconcile myself to the thought that
Tom Cooper ever did such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless he did, and you may take my
word for it, for I saw the bundle he had the diamonds
hidden away in.”</p>

<p>“I would have to have his word for it,” said the
girl with flaming cheeks and rising from her
chair.</p>

<p>“Be seated,” ordered Benson, “and we will
avoid unpleasant subjects.”</p>

<p>She sank again into her chair and listened.</p>

<p>“I wanted to know if you wish me to manage
your business for you for a while yet, for it will
be some time before you are of age, and I am your
trustee.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you are to do as you have done. I
desire it. Is that all you wish me to say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied with a gratified smile.</p>

<p>He walked to the door with her and impulsively
took her hand in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>“Child,” said he, “I want you to grow fond of
your cousin. I have your welfare at heart.”</p>

<p>The tears sprang into her eyes as she heard
this.</p>

<p>But, saying nothing, she ran quickly upstairs
and threw herself into Biddy’s arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, Biddy, that man drives me crazy. He
is always bringing to my mind that I cannot have
Tom for so many years; grow fond of him, never,
even if he is my own cousin.”</p>

<p>The decision that she would see a lawyer on her
own account made her restless until one afternoon
she ordered the carriage and drove down
Broadway.</p>

<p>“I want to stop at Wanamaker’s,” said she to
the coachman, “and you wait for me. I have much
shopping to do.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to purchase one article, she
went through the store into the rear street and
took a car.</p>

<p>There was something always in the attitude of
the servants that made her think that she was
being spied upon, and certainly if the man<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
thought she was buying girlish trash she would
be free to do as she had planned.</p>

<p>She stopped in front of a tall building and disappeared
inside.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr. Campbell,” said she at a law
office.</p>

<p>A young man bowed before her, and she
thought by the expression of his face that she
could trust him. Starting from the beginning of
her mother’s life as far back as she knew, she told
the story. Then, coming down to the present, she
related her fears about her lover.</p>

<p>“He is innocent,” declared the girl, “and you
may name your own price if you will help me to
get him out of prison.”</p>

<p>The young lawyer could not but admire the
girl. She could give him but meagre knowledge
of Tom’s trouble, but names were added, so that
he could get his own evidence.</p>

<p>“And I do not want you to ever write me. I
am suspicious of my cousin and those pretending
to be my friends, and as long as they think that I<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
am doing nothing for Tom I am safe, but I fear
the consequences otherwise.”</p>

<p>The lawyer promised and soon the eagle-eyed
coachman, who was being paid by Benson to keep
his eye upon his young mistress, saw the girl
emerge from Wanamaker’s, and wave her finger
at him from the distance. She had been gone just
two hours.</p>

<p>“Home,” was all she said.</p>

<p>“Biddy,” whispered Nellie, after she and the
woman were in bed, “you told me to look up a
lawyer, and I did it to-day. I did not buy any of
those things I said I did.”</p>

<p>“No?” inquired the woman.</p>

<p>“Indeed not, I simply went into a store and out
the back door, and let the carriage wait for me in
front. Why, do you know I fear even the eyes of
Brown. When he drives me anywhere, he always
looks as if he were memorizing the number of the
place. But how contentedly he waited until I
came out of the store, and he was nearly asleep
upon the box.”</p>

<p>Biddy shook the bed with hearty laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got the brain,” said she softly, and
then they fell asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Old Nathans was so angry about the coming of
Nellie upon the scene that he stormed every time
he came to the Benson home.</p>

<p>“You are a fool,” raved he, “a perfect fool.
Long ago you ought to have settled this affair,
instead of calling upon me for such large
amounts. Now then, unless you get some of that
girl’s money or get her out of the way, we will
both be ruined. She is a crafty witch.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but does not take a step that she is not
watched.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she fools you.”</p>

<p>“Not much; I am paying the servants well.”</p>

<p>“Women are not to be trusted,” commented
Nathans, “for when you think you know just
what they are doing that is the time you get
fooled.”</p>

<p>Benson made no reply to this.</p>

<p>“The only thing I want,” went on the Jew<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
angrily, “is some of the money I’ve let you have
the past fifteen years and before that time. Now,
get a hustle on yourself, and don’t keep me waiting
any longer. I should think with that Tom
out of the way it would be easy enough to put her
out of our path.”</p>

<p>“You tried it once,” said Benson, “and utterly
failed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you remember that Tom Cooper was
not then in jail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he was,” tantalized Benson.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean that he was with her. Now he
is not.”</p>

<p>“There is some truth in that,” replied the other,
“but I have my own opinion that we have gone to
the length of our tether, and she may outwit us
after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that little Bowery tough was at the shop
the other day, and asked for his reward for finding
the girl and the man. I just laughed at him,
and told him to scoot.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Benson. “We won’t
give him any thousand; it is too hard to get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“So ’tis, but aren’t you afraid he’ll squeal on
us?”</p>

<p>“His word wouldn’t be much,” scoffed Benson.
“If he comes to me I shall soon give him a piece
of my mind.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment there came a rap at the
door, and the servant announced:</p>

<p>“Mr. Jim Farren.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Halloa, Jim,” said Nathans, “have you come
to worry the good gentleman?”</p>

<p>“I’ve come for what’s due me!” growled the
boy.</p>

<p>“Due you? Nothing is due you. Don’t think
you can demand a sum of money and then get it.
What have you done for us?”</p>

<p>“Got you the girl, and pointed out Cooper. You
and Benson wouldn’t have known about them if
it hadn’t been for me.”</p>

<p>Nathans shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Heap you did for us. Look, the girl’s saddled
upon her cousin for no telling how long, and
Cooper is only serving a term which does us no
good.”</p>

<p>Jim cackled a funny little laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>“Pooh,” said he. “I wouldn’t give five cents
for that girl’s chance of life if you two got your
hands upon her. Poor little thing, she is too
pretty to be with men like you.”</p>

<p>He crossed his legs and puffed out smoke from
a vile-smelling cigar.</p>

<p>“Don’t get too personal, young fellow,” said
the Jew, “but there, there, Benson, I’ll leave you
with this young degenerate. Young fellow, if you
had made a finish of the job you began fifteen
years ago, you would not be in the position you
are in now, and we would be able to hold our
heads up with the best of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, now all you have to do is to twist the
girl’s neck like this,” and the villain screwed his
fingers deftly around, “and then we three could
be rich.”</p>

<p>He squinted his eye to one side as he said this,
and the Jew gave a great gasp.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a nerve, young fellow, that exceeds
anything I have ever seen. Now then, I’ll
leave you to settle with Benson.”</p>

<p>All this time George Benson said nothing, but<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
was looking curiously at the miniature man. Jim
Farren was of under size, with a brutal-looking
face. After the Jew had gone the escaped convict
looked his question and Benson said suddenly:</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’ve a good nerve to come
here and ask to get a certain sum of money you
did not earn? If you had not interfered with our
arrangements fifteen years ago and helped that
sailor to escape you would have been all right
now. He would still have been serving a sentence
and the girl would be dead. You had better
go away.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been seeing my Cousin Biddy,” said the
man, thinking to gain time.</p>

<p>“Well, you had better leave this house, and
don’t come around whining to me. If you had
had any sense you would have kept that Arkwright
from my heels. I dare not take a step for
fear he will hound me.”</p>

<p>The man looked again sharply at Benson.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean that you cannot kill the
girl without it being found out?”</p>

<p>“Hush, wretch, you talk too loud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>“I am thinking my voice will be heard outside
this wall if something isn’t done soon,” replied
Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, do you? You are trying to threaten
me, are you? Well, don’t do that, for it won’t
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t it? Well, we will see. Now then,
are youse going to give me that money?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not one cent?”</p>

<p>“No, not even a half a cent, and if you try anything
we will send you up for the rest of your
term.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Mr. Benson. Some folks situated like
I am ain’t any too particular how they live when
they don’t have no money. I don’t know but as
I’d lief be at Blackwell’s as here in the city, but
maybe I rather be there if I could get even with
men what has done me an injustice.”</p>

<p>Benson’s face had grown white to his ears, and
he had no hold upon his temper. He rose suddenly
to his feet, and Jim, thinking it best to get
out, ran into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>There he met Biddy sailing down the stairs.
This woman had improved herself a great deal
since coming in a mansion to live, and she eyed
her cousin with great scorn.</p>

<p>“Jim, why are youse about here with that dirty
face? Seems to me youse might have some
thought for me. Now, get out of here and don’t
come again until it can be clean.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone back on me,” said Jim, pointing his
finger to the library door.</p>

<p>“Glad of it,” said the woman; “you are both as
bad as you can be. I hope you will find your way
to jail for being so mean to our little girl when
she was small. If she were not an angel she
would not let any of you people in the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t she?” cried he. “Well, she’d
better not get too flip, for Mr. Benson runs this
house.”</p>

<p>“Who said he did?” asked the Irishwoman, her
blue eyes fastening upon the man keenly.</p>

<p>“He did,” replied Jim, looking toward Benson’s
door.</p>

<p>Biddy muttered something about things going<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
topsy turvy and that she would tell Nellie her
mind, and Jim walked out.</p>

<p>He slouched along the street with his hands in
his pockets. His idea was to think of some way
he could get even with Benson without running
any risk himself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One afternoon Nellie was sitting writing her
daily letter to Tom. Her mind had left the sheet
before her, and with her eyes fixed upon the ivy-covered
church opposite she tried to weave a day
dream which would bring her happiness. How
many weary months had passed since her Tom
had gone to prison, and each day her cousin became
more insufferable and she hated him more
and more. He had constantly persecuted her
with his attentions.</p>

<p>It would be well to cite a little episode which
had happened only a few days before. Benson
had gotten it into his mind that Biddy interfered
with Nellie as far as he was concerned; that is,<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
influenced her against him, so he determined to
banish the woman from the house, and with this
intention he set about finding a woman who
would take Biddy’s place.</p>

<p>One morning he sent a peremptory message to
Nellie to come to him in the library, which was
his favorite place to meet her.</p>

<p>“Helen,” said he, rising at her entrance, “you
will listen to what I am going to say to you, and
know, please, before I begin, that it is for your
own good that I speak.”</p>

<p>“Then do not hesitate,” replied the girl with so
much sarcasm in her voice that the man’s face
flooded with color.</p>

<p>“Please do not use that tone to me,” said he
sternly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” and Helen sank gracefully back
into her seat.</p>

<p>“Helen,” and Benson commenced in low, measured
tones, “you are much younger than I am,
but that is no reason why I should not care for
you or you for me. I am only your second cousin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>The man paused a moment, and Nellie, thinking
it incumbent upon her to speak, said:</p>

<p>“I do not see what you mean.”</p>

<p>“This,” replied Benson. “Nellie, I love you. I
want you to be my wife, and because I do love you
I desire that you should come under good influence,
and I require that you should allow Biddy
to leave this house. It is a shame to keep her
here.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face changed color. She did not
speak and allowed him to go on.</p>

<p>“I believe this woman exerts a bad influence
over you, for she is not a lady and could not be
made into one, no matter how hard she would try,
nor whatever was done for her. I have hired you
a good woman to take her place, and have notified
Biddy to leave to-night. I allowed you to bring
her with you because you were coming into a
strange house. Will you be good enough to say
something, and not sit there looking at me like
that?”</p>

<p>Still the girl was silent, while a mixture of
emotions were arising in her breast. This man<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
had taken such a hold upon her, had constituted
himself her husband without her consent, and
would send away her beloved Biddy, and——</p>

<p>Here her thoughts changed their current, and
she thought of the man in the prison cell. Marry
George Benson—never. Let Biddy go out of her
life, delightful, droll old Biddy, whom she loved?
No, she would go, too, then.</p>

<p>Seeing that she was not going to speak, and
hoping that she had taken his words as they were
meant, the man arose and opened the door which
opened into his private office.</p>

<p>“Miss Wallace, will you please come in?”</p>

<p>An angular-looking woman, with an evil eye,
and who looked fixedly at Nellie, glided into the
room.</p>

<p>“This is your new companion, Nellie,” said
Benson genially, “and I know you will like each
other. Now you will take her to your suite of
rooms, Helen, and show her where she is to
sleep.”</p>

<p>It was now time for Nellie to speak. She rose
like a young empress and faced her guardian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>“You have gone a little too far,” said she,
throwing back her head haughtily; “just a little
too far——”</p>

<p>But before she could say anything more the
woman had taken her by the arm and whispered:</p>

<p>“We shall be the best of friends. There is nothing
Miss Standish can ask me to do that I will be
unwilling to try.”</p>

<p>Nellie shook off the white fingers.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” shivered the girl; “I will not
have you near me, do you understand? I won’t
have you in my Biddy’s place. I will bid you
good-night, Mr. Benson, and say that when I am
twenty-one, I shall come back and you shall leave
this house, but now, to-night, do you hear,” and
the girl bent far forward and looked into the
man’s eyes, “do you understand, I am going back
to the boathouse with my Biddy.”</p>

<p>With this sweeping statement, she flung herself
out of the room, and fled upstairs, and she no
sooner came near the door but she heard the
sound of sobs. Opening it, she saw Biddy down<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
upon her knees beside a trunk throwing her
things in promiscuously.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Biddy?” asked the girl
sternly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Benson has told me to leave, and, darlint,
it is better for you. I am not a lady, he says, but
I loved you, child; I loved you.”</p>

<p>“Biddy, listen to me. Are you going back to
the boathouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I am going with you. I just told Mr.
Benson, too, and also said to that vixen in a black
dress, who he said was to be my companion, that
I would have nothing to do with her.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him that?” and Biddy sat down
upon the floor and ceased her sobbing and looked
at her darling.</p>

<p>“I did, and I’m going with you, Biddy. I told
him I would come back when I was twenty-one
and take charge of the house, and until that time
he could reign here with the companion he had
chosen for me.”</p>

<p>Saying this, she had commenced to tear the<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
things out of the closet. But a knock caused her
to cease.</p>

<p>Benson was standing looking at her with a
pleading expression in his eyes. He hated to
admit that he could not tame this very young girl,
and that she would take no wish of his into consideration,
much less an order.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Helen?” asked he, looking
about the room.</p>

<p>“Getting ready to go with Biddy. I suppose
the new companion will need these rooms.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, Nellie,” commenced the man.
“You are to stay in your home, for it is not to be
thought of, your leaving it.”</p>

<p>“Then if I stay, Biddy shall stay, too.”</p>

<p>Benson hesitated. The dark eyes under the
shock of golden hair were flashing at him their
challenge.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the man slowly, “let Biddy stay.
I did not think you would take any such drastic
measures. I hope you won’t regret it.”</p>

<p>“But she will,” he muttered as he made his way
downstairs and dismissed the new woman, who,<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
with a very dark smile upon her face, laughed
him to scorn for his indecision.</p>

<p>“I should like the managing of that young girl
for a little while,” said she slowly, “and I think I
could bring her to time.”</p>

<p>“Leave your address. I may need you,” replied
Benson, as he showed her the door.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now this day Nellie was writing her experience
to Tom.</p>

<p>“As if I could live here without Biddy, Tom,”
wrote she. “And with the woman he hired for
my companion. You have no idea how repugnant
she was to me. Oh, Tom, is this misery never
to cease? Now I have but a little money to do as
I want to with, but, my beloved, it won’t be long
before I can spend all the money I wish. Then
for freedom for you and happiness for me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This letter was received at the prison and the
warden congratulated Tom upon having such a<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
constant little sweetheart, but the tone of the
missive was anything but satisfactory to Tom.
He believed that Biddy would be sent away and
Nellie would be left alone with Benson.</p>

<p>He thought of this so long that the idea seemed
to set his brain on fire, and he could see his
darling going through all sorts of things and tortures
to make her give over the money to Nathans
and her cousin. He pictured in his mind this
woman, who had been brought to take the place
of the faithful Irishwoman, who had been his and
Nellie’s friend since their terrible experience in
the river fifteen years before. He suddenly made
up his mind to escape that night from the prison.</p>

<p>And escape he did. He slipped out of his place
in the line of men and hid behind a large pile of
lumber where some carpenters were at work. One
man had taken off his suit of blue overalls, and
thrown it down upon the boards, and instantly
Tom had put this on, and had calmly walked out
of the gate with the set of carpenters.</p>

<p>When he once was in the open air his thoughts
immediately went to Helen. He would change<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
his clothes, and then satisfy himself how his
sweetheart was getting along.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Helen Standish was growing impatient, and
her twenty-first birthday was fast crowding upon
her—that time when she would be her own mistress.</p>

<p>This thought often haunted both Benson and
Nathans. The Jew had tormented Benson with
his fears and worryings.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to marry that girl or put her out
of the way,” commanded the Jew, and Benson
knew this to be a fact, for was he not involved to
such an amount that he could not stand under the
strain much longer?</p>

<p>So this evening he sent for his ward, and said
to her:</p>

<p>“My dear Helen, I am going to ask you a question.
Will you marry me? I love you, and I beg
you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>The girl rose to her feet. Her eyes narrowed<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
into just a squint, for she seemed to be measuring
his strength against hers. There was something
so strong in her feelings to-night. Was she not
twenty-one to-morrow and mistress of her own
fortune? And did it not mean freedom for her
Tom?</p>

<p>“I thank you, my cousin,” said she, bowing low,
“but I will have to decline the honor. What is
more, to-morrow I will want my home to myself,
as I am thinking of making several changes
among the servants. And then, my lawyer says
that you should hand me a statement of all the
moneys spent since my grandfather died, and
then please turn my property over to me.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Then this slip of a girl had outwitted him after
all, and had hired a lawyer without his knowledge
or consent.</p>

<p>“You cannot mean what you say, Helen,” he
said presently.</p>

<p>“Every word,” was her short answer.</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to make arrangements to-night.
You will have to excuse me.”</p>

<p>While he was saying this, Nathans was ushered
into the room as the girl went out by another
door.</p>

<p>“I was just wanting you, Nathans. The girl
has stepped over the traces, and has asked me to
leave here to-morrow, when she becomes of age,
and asks for control of her property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>“Then she dies to-night,” decided the Jew.
“You cannot give her any statement or I will be
without the money you have borrowed of me.
Now is the time to get rid of her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“I do. You send for her, and let me teach you
a thing or two.”</p>

<p>As Nellie went out she heard the bell give a
long ring, and waited in the hall to see who it
might be. Arkwright, the detective, walked in.</p>

<p>“Miss Standish, Miss Helen, wait, I want to
speak with you particularly. Is Tom Cooper
here?”</p>

<p>Nellie staggered back against the wall.</p>

<p>“He has escaped from the prison, and is being
traced toward here. He went as far as the sailor’s
boathouse, and then further track of him was
lost. Now then, little girl, if he is here tell me,
for it will be better for him. I have been working
upon his case for a long time; in fact, ever
since you became fond of him, and it may be that
he will be released. Don’t keep him hidden, Miss
Standish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>“He is not here; honestly he is not,” answered
the girl.</p>

<p>“I believe you, child,” replied the detective,
“and will say this much: Lately I have had reason
to believe that the Jew who keeps the pawnshop
in which your lover was arrested is a fraud,
and he was the one who lodged a complaint
against Cooper. But I cannot buy him over. Now
my idea was that you were to listen and hear anything
that might be said between your cousin and
the Jew which would lead to the discovery of the
man who stole the jewels.”</p>

<p>“I shall be too glad,” breathed the girl. “I believe
that my lover is suffering for another’s
crime. What you can do for me I will gladly pay
for.”</p>

<p>“Then help yourself by listening.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t you stay here to-night, Mr. Arkwright?
I think something is going to happen,
and if it does I shall need you.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall stay,” said he, for what man
could withstand such eyes and such pleading?</p>

<p>“I shall hide in here, then,” said he, “and if<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
Tom Cooper comes here will you trust me with
his future?”</p>

<p>And the girl promised.</p>

<p>It was Biddy’s business to put the family silver
away in the vault every night, and this evening
Benson could not get her out soon enough.</p>

<p>“Will you hurry, Irish?” said he insultingly, as
he and the Jew laughed.</p>

<p>“I am hurrying,” said she, “as fast as I can.”</p>

<p>“And I want to tell you another thing, Biddy,”
commanded Benson, “I saw your cousin Jim
about here this evening, and if I see him again I
shall hand him over to the police.”</p>

<p>The woman started visibly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t my fault that he comes,” said she,
shoving one after another of the heavy plates inside.
“Here, I will get the rest.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Benson, “not now; I am in a
hurry to finish with Mr. Nathans. You can come
in later.”</p>

<p>As the woman went into the dining-room she
came upon her cousin.</p>

<p>“Jim,” commenced she, “you’d better not let<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Mr. Benson see you about here, for he said he
would give you over to the police if he did.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him,” replied the man sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Well, youse know that he can, for he is strong
and mighty. Now, for the sake of your mother,
straighten up and be a good man.”</p>

<p>“Too much trouble, Biddy,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell upon the heavy silver upon
the table.</p>

<p>“Plated?” asked he, lifting one up.</p>

<p>“No, and you put it down,” commanded Biddy,
“your fingers are light enough to even let that
heavy dish stick to ’em.”</p>

<p>With this she went out with another load and
deposited it near the library, grumbling that a
woman was not allowed to do her work in any
season at all.</p>

<p>Jim, with a sudden thought, hid in the pantry.</p>

<p>“I’ll get into the safe to-night,” whispered he to
himself, “and get even with that cove by lugging
away the best of the plates.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he subsided like a thief while waiting<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
until the lights were turned out, and then to
set about his work.</p>

<p>In the meantime Nellie was listening to the
murmured conversation in the library.</p>

<p>The voice of her cousin came clear to the girl’s
ear.</p>

<p>“I say we are ruined, and there’s no use sending
for her and arguing the matter, and she simply
hates me, and you can’t take a girl like her and
marry her against her will.”</p>

<p>“I will not listen to such a thing as giving her
a statement of her account,” said the Jew.</p>

<p>“We will have to,” said Benson again.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” and by close peeking Nellie
could see Nathans lean over toward her cousin to
see the effect of his words, “they have gotten onto
the fact that there was something crooked about
that jewel story which we trumped up against
Tom Cooper, and that little minx had all the
police force upon the trail. Even Arkwright came
to me about it.”</p>

<p><a id="BRef_182" href="#Ref_182">“Then she must die,”</a> said Benson, standing up.</p>

<p>“That’s what I have said,” repeated the Jew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“But how to manage it,” cried the other; “how
to manage it.”</p>

<p>“Send for her,” laughed the Jew, “and I will
try again to get her life like I did that time fifteen
years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now Tom Cooper is in jail that is
some consolation, and if we could fix her that is
all we would want.”</p>

<p>Just then there came a sound, and both men
turned.</p>

<p>A girl with flashing eyes stood before them.</p>

<p>Nellie Standish, too brave for her own good,
was ready to make a strike for her lover.</p>

<p>“You have confessed your crime, and here goes
for calling the police.”</p>

<p>She pressed the electric button, but instantly
the Jew had her in his arms and had crushed her
into the vault and shut the door upon her. Her
stifled cry did not reach the ear of anyone.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nathans, “there is but one thing
left. Go to the top of the house. Get the girl’s
jewels, and then burn the house about her ears,<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
and no one will ever discover her loss, but will
think that she perished in the flames.”</p>

<p>With trembling steps the men went out together,
but they did not see a sly figure watching
them. Jim ran into the library and tried to open
the vault. He succeeded in pulling the heavy
door open and a figure panting for breath
dropped out upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, somebody give me breath to breathe,”
gasped she. “Please, please.”</p>

<p>The two men were running down the steps making
their way to the street when they heard
Helen’s voice.</p>

<p>“She is not dead, Benson,” cried Nathans;
“come, we will finish her with this,” and he
waved a revolver over his head.</p>

<p>But when they turned into the library they
came face to face with Tom Cooper.</p>

<p>He wrenched the revolver from the Jew’s hand,
but Benson drew another.</p>

<p>“You think that you can save her, fool; you
shall both go to the Kingdom Come. Now
then——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>But Arkwright was there. He put out his hand
and drew the weapon from Benson.</p>

<p>“I am here,” said he quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, they tried to kill me,” cried the girl,
clinging to her lover, “and I heard them say that
they put the jewels in your bundle the night you
were arrested.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie,” growled the Jew.</p>

<p>“A deuced lie,” repeated Benson.</p>

<p>“No, ’taint, mister,” said a voice, and Jim Farren
wriggled out from behind a large rack where
he had crawled when he saw the white figure fall
out upon him. He thought that a ghost was in
the house.</p>

<p>“’Taint no lie,” he went on leeringly, “I saw
them do it that night, cove, in the pawnshop, and
’cause I knowed you was innocent I helped you to
get out.”</p>

<p>“What will you do, Mr. Detective, if I turn
State’s evidence?” said the cringing Nathans; “I
do not want to go to jail.”</p>

<p>“We have enough evidence without yours, my<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
fine Jew,” said Arkwright, “and you will go
where you belong.”</p>

<p>Nellie was languishing in her lover’s arms. She
looked into his face and whispered:</p>

<p>“Oh, my sweetheart, think of one year ago to-day;
what terrible things have happened since
then.”</p>

<p>“I know, beloved, but now that the troubles are
past, we will be happy.”</p>

<p>Biddy insisted that she be allowed to return to
her boathouse, and after many arguings Nellie
consented, only stipulating that she should have
the house nicely fixed up and a lot of new boats,
and that Biddy should take in no more washing.</p>

<p>“Nellie, darlint,” said Biddy the day she was
making ready to leave the mansion home, “would
you care if I should take Jim to live with me?
He promises to be a good man and will give up
drinking and being a tough.”</p>

<p>“I have no objections, Biddy, unless he fills
your old days with worry. You tell him that I<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
said that if he were a good fellow both Tom and I
would help him along.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="Ref_187" href="#BRef_187">There was a quiet marriage</a> between a man and
a very pretty woman. The minister kissed the
charming little bride and wished her many happy
years. But Nellie noticed that he looked curiously
at the bridegroom’s closely-shaven head.
Of course, Tom would not wait for his happiness.
He persuaded Nellie that the sooner they were
married the better. All that the girl wanted before
her marriage was to see the two men who had
tried to ruin her life, dealt with according to law
and then she consented to get married.</p>

</div>

<p>As they were driving home through the cool
night air, Nellie was resting in the arms of her
lover and husband, and he whispered softly:
“Beloved, if it had not been for you, I should still
have been in prison. But, thanks to my dear
sweetheart, I have her now for a dear little wife.”</p>

<p>Slowly they drove along toward home, and suddenly<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
Helen looked up with a shudder, which was
immediately followed by a smile.</p>

<p>“Tom, dear,” murmured she, “if there ever was
a man who deserved a good home and wife, it is
you, for all your life you have been shrouded by
‘<span class="smcap">The Shadows of a Great City</span>.’”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
